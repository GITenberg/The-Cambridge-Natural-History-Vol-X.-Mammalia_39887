<h5 class="lg150">PREFACE</h5>

  <p>Inasmuch as Sir W. H. Flower and Mr. Lydekker could not profess to
  treat the Mammalia exhaustively within the limits of nearly 800 pages, in
  their <i>Introduction to the Study of Mammals</i>, it is obvious that the
  present volume, which appears ten years later and is of rather less size,
  can contain but a selection of the enormous mass of facts at the disposal
  of the student of this group. Thus the chief question for myself was what
  to select and what to leave aside. It will be observed that I have
  reduced the pages of this book to conformity with those of other volumes
  of the series by treating some groups more briefly than others. It has
  appeared to me to be desirable to treat fully such groups as the Edentata
  and the Marsupialia, and permissible to be more brief in dealing with
  such huge Orders as those of the Rodentia and Chiroptera. Lengthy
  disquisitions upon such familiar and comparatively uninteresting animals
  as the Lion and Leopard have been curtailed, and the space thus saved has
  been devoted to shorter and more numerous accounts of other creatures. As
  there are nearly six hundred genera of living Mammals known to science,
  omission as well as compression became an absolute necessity. I have
  given, I hope, adequate treatment from the standpoint of a necessarily
  limited treatise to the majority of the more important genera of Mammals
  both living and extinct; but the length of this part of the book had to
  be increased by the discoveries, which give me at once an advantage and a
  disadvantage as compared with the two authors whose names I have quoted,
  of a considerable number of important new types in the last ten years.
  <!-- Page iv --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pageiv"></a>{iv}</span>Such forms as <i>Notoryctes</i>,
  <i>Romerolagus</i>, <i>Caenolestes</i>, "<i>Neomylodon</i>," and
  <i>Ocapia</i> could not possibly have been omitted.</p>

  <p>In preparing my accounts of both living and extinct forms I have
  nearly invariably consulted the original authorities, and have often
  supplemented or verified these accounts by my own dissections at the
  Zoological Society's Gardens. My rule has not, however, been invariable
  in this matter, inasmuch as there exist two recent and trustworthy
  text-books of Mammalian Palaeontology&mdash;Professor Zittel's
  <i>Handbuch der Palaeontologie</i>, and Dr. A. Smith Woodward's manual,
  <i>Outlines of Vertebrate Palaeontology</i>, in the Cambridge Biological
  Series. Where the name of a genus only or its range, or merely one or two
  facts about it, are mentioned, I have not thought it necessary to go
  further than these two works. But a good deal has been done even since
  the appearance of these two volumes which it will be found that I have
  not ignored.</p>

  <p>I have to thank my editors for the trouble which they have taken in
  the revision of the proofs and for many suggestions. To Professor Osborn,
  of Columbia University, New York, I am indebted for some kind
  suggestions. My daughter Iris has assisted me in various ways. Finally, I
  desire to express my indebtedness to Mr. Dixon and to Mr. M. P. Parker
  for the care which they have taken in the preparation of the figures
  which were drawn by them especially for this work.</p>

<h5 class="lg150">CHAPTER I</h5>

<h6>INTRODUCTORY</h6>

  <p>The Mammalia form a group of vertebrated animals which roughly
  correspond with what are termed in popular language "quadrupeds," or with
  the still more vernacular terms of "beasts" or "animals." The name
  "Mammal" is derived from the most salient characteristic of the group,
  <i>i.e.</i> the possession of teats; but if the term were used in an
  absolutely strict etymological sense, it could not include the
  Monotremes, which, though they have mammary glands, have not
  fully-differentiated teats (see p. <a href="#page16">16</a>). There are,
  however, as will be seen shortly, other characters which necessitate the
  inclusion of these egg-laying quadrupeds within the class Mammalia.</p>

  <p>The Mammalia are unquestionably the highest of the Vertebrata. This
  statement, however, though generally acceptable, needs some explanation
  and justification. "Highest" implies perfection, or, at any rate,
  relative perfection. It might be said with perfect truth that a serpent
  is in its way an example of perfection of structure: not incommoded with
  limbs it can slip rapidly through the grass, swim like a fish, climb like
  a monkey, and dart upon its prey with rapidity and accuracy. It is an
  example of an extremely specialised reptile, the loss of the limbs being
  the most obvious way in which it is specialised from more generalised
  reptilian types. Specialisation in fact is often synonymous with
  degradation, and, this being the case, implies a restricted life. On the
  other hand, simplification is not always to be read as degeneration. The
  lower jaw, for instance, of mammals has fewer bones in it than that of
  reptiles, and is more concisely articulated to the skull; this implies
  greater efficiency <!-- Page 2 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page2"></a>{2}</span>as a biting organ. The term highest, however,
  includes increased complexity as well as simplification, the two series
  of modifications being interwoven to form a more efficient organism. It
  cannot be doubted that the increased complexity of the brain of mammals
  raises them in the scale, as does also the complex and delicately
  adjusted series of bonelets which form the organ for the transmission of
  sound to the internal ear. The separation of the cavity containing the
  lungs, and the investment of the partition so formed with muscular
  fibres, renders the action of the lungs more effective; and there are
  other instances among the Mammalia of greater complexity of the various
  parts and organs of the body when compared with lower forms, which help
  to justify the term "highest" generally applied to these creatures.</p>

  <p>Complexity and finish of structure are often accompanied by large
  size; and the Mammalia are, on the whole, larger than any other
  Vertebrates, and also contain the most colossal species. The huge
  Dinosaurs of the Mesozoic epoch, though among the largest of animals, are
  exceeded by the Whales; and the latter group includes the mightiest
  creature that exists or has ever existed, the eighty-five-feet-long
  Sibbald's Rorqual. Confining ourselves rigidly to facts, and avoiding all
  theorising on the possible relation between complexity and nicety of
  build and the capacity for increase in bulk, it is plain from the history
  of more than one group of mammals that increase in bulk accompanies
  specialisation of structure. The huge Dinocerata when compared with the
  ancestral <i>Pantolambda</i> teach us this, as do many similar examples.
  Within the mammalian group, as in the case of other Vertebrates,
  difference of size has a certain rough correspondence with difference of
  habitat. The Whales not only contain the largest of animals, but their
  average size is great; so too with the equally aquatic Sirenia and very
  aquatic Pinnipedia. Here the support offered by the water and the
  consequent decreased need for muscular power to neutralise the effects of
  gravity permit of an increase in bulk. Purely terrestrial animals come
  next; and finally arboreal, and, still more, "flying" mammals are of
  small size, since the maintenance of the position when moving and feeding
  needs enormous muscular effort.</p>

  <p>The Mammals are more easily to be separated from the Vertebrates lying
  lower in the series than any of the latter are from each other in
  ascending order. A large number of <!-- Page 3 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page3"></a>{3}</span>characters might be used in
  addition to those which will be made use of in the following brief
  catalogue of essential mammalian features, were it not for the low-placed
  Monotremata on the one hand and the highly specialised Whales on the
  other. Including those forms, the Mammalia are to be distinguished from
  all other Vertebrates by the following series of structural features,
  which will be expanded later into a short disquisition upon the general
  structure of the Mammalia. The class Mammalia may, in fact, be thus
  defined<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>Hair-clad Vertebrates, with cutaneous glands in the female, secreting
  milk for the nourishment of the young. Skull without prefrontal,
  postfrontal, quadrato-jugal, and some other bones, and with two occipital
  condyles formed entirely by the exoccipitals. Lower jaw composed of
  dentary bone only, articulating only with the squamosal. Ear bones a
  chain of three or four separate bonelets. Cervical vertebrae sharply
  distinguished from the dorsals, and if with free ribs, showing no
  transition between these and the thoracic ribs. Brain with four optic
  lobes. Lungs and heart separated from abdominal cavity by a muscular
  diaphragm. Heart with a single left aortic arch. Red blood-corpuscles
  non-nucleate.</p>

  <p>The following characters are also very nearly universal, and in any
  case absolutely distinctive<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span>Cervical
  vertebrae, seven; vertebrae with epiphyses. Ankle-joint "cruro-tarsal,"
  <i>i.e.</i> between the leg and the ankle, and not in the middle of the
  ankle.<a name="NtA_1" href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Attachment of the
  pelvis to the vertebral column pre-acetabular in position.</p>

  <p>The Mammalia since they are hot-blooded creatures are more independent
  of temperature than reptiles; they are thus found spread over a wider
  area of the earth's surface. As however, though hot-blooded, they have
  not the powers of locomotion possessed by birds, they are not quite so
  widely distributed as are those animals. The Mammalia range up into the
  extreme north, but, excepting only forms mainly aquatic, such as the Sea
  Lions, are not known to occur on the Antarctic continent. With the
  exception of the flying Bats, indigenous mammals are totally absent from
  New Zealand; and it seems to be doubtful whether those supposed oceanic
  islands which have a mammalian fauna are really <!-- Page 4 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page4"></a>{4}</span>oceanic in origin. The
  continents and oceans are peopled by rather over three thousand species
  of Mammalia, a number which is considerably less than that of either
  birds or reptiles. It seems clear that, so far at any rate as concerns
  the numbers of families and genera, the mammalian fauna of to-day is less
  varied than it was during the Mid-tertiary period, the heyday of
  mammalian life. It is rather remarkable to contrast in this way the
  mammals and the birds. The two classes of the animal kingdom seem to have
  come into being at about the same period; but the birds either have
  reached their culminating point to-day, or have not yet reached it. The
  Mammalia, on the other hand, multiplied to an extraordinary extent during
  the Eocene and the Miocene periods, and have since dwindled. The break is
  most marked at the close of the Pleistocene, and may be in part due to
  the direct influence of man. At present man exercises so enormous an
  effect, both directly and indirectly, that the future history of the
  Mammalia is probably foreshadowed by the instances of the White
  Rhinoceros and the Quagga. On the other hand, the economic usefulness of
  the Mammalia is greater than that of any other animals; and the next most
  important era in their history will be probably that of domesticity and
  "preservation."</p>

<h5 class="lg150">CHAPTER II</h5>

<h6>STRUCTURE AND PRESENT DISTRIBUTION OF THE MAMMALIA</h6>

  <p><b>External Form.</b>&mdash;It would be quite impossible for any one
  to confuse any other quadrupedal animal with a mammal. The body of a
  reptile is, as it were, slung between its limbs, like the body of an
  eighteenth century chariot between its four wheels; in the mammal the
  body is raised entirely above, and is supported by, the four limbs. The
  axes of these limbs too, as a general rule, are parallel with the
  vertical axis of the body of their possessor. There is thus a greater
  perfection of the relations of the limbs to the trunk from the point of
  view of a terrestrial creature, which has to use those limbs for rapid
  movement. The same perfection in these relations is to be seen, it should
  be observed, in such running forms among the lower Vertebrata as the
  Birds and the Dinosaurs, where the actual angulation of the limbs is as
  in the purely running Mammalia. These relations are of course absolutely
  lost in the aquatic Cetacea, and not marked in various burrowing
  creatures. The way in which the fore- and hind-limbs are angulated is
  considerably different in the two cases. In the latter, which are most
  used and, as it were, push on the anterior part of the body, the femur
  has its lower end directed forwards, the tibia and the fibula project
  backwards at the lower end, while the ankle and foot are again inclined
  in the same direction as the femur. With the fore-limbs there is not this
  regular alternation. The humerus is directed backwards, the fore-arm
  forwards, and the hand still more forwards. This angulation seems to
  facilitate movement, inasmuch as it is seen in even the Amphibia and the
  lower Reptiles, in which, however, the differences between the fore- and
  hind-limbs are less marked, <!-- Page 6 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page6"></a>{6}</span>indicating therefore a less specialised
  condition of the limbs. It is an interesting fact that the angulation of
  the limbs is to some extent obliterated in very bulky creatures, and
  almost entirely so in the elephants (see p. <a href="#page217">217</a>),
  which seem to need strong and straight pillars for the due support of
  their huge bodies.</p>

  <p>The alertness and general intellectual superiority of mammals to all
  animals lying below them in the series (with the exception of the birds,
  which are in their way almost on a level with the Mammalia) are seen by
  their active and continuous movements. The lengthy periods of absolute
  motionlessness, so familiar to everybody in such a creature as the
  Crocodile, are unknown among the more typical Mammalia except indeed
  during sleep. This mental condition is clearly shown by the proportionate
  development of the external parts of all the organs of the higher senses.
  The Mammalia as a rule have well-developed, often extremely large, flaps
  of skin surrounding the entrance to the organ of hearing, often called
  "ears," but better termed "pinnae." These are provided with special
  muscles, and can be often moved and in many directions. The nose is
  always, or nearly always, very conspicuous by its naked character; by the
  large surface, often moist, which surrounds the nostrils; and again by
  the muscles, which enable this tract of the integument to be moved at
  will. The eyes, perhaps, are less marked in their predominance over the
  eyes of lower Vertebrates than are the ears and nose; but they are
  provided as a rule with upper and lower eyelids, as well as by a
  nictitating membrane as in lower Vertebrates. The apparent predominance
  of the senses of smell and hearing over that of sight appears to be
  marked in the Mammalia, and may account for their diversity of voice as
  well as of odour, and for the general sameness of coloration which
  distinguishes this group from the brilliantly-coloured birds and
  reptiles. The head, too, which bears these organs of special sense, is
  more obviously marked out from the neck and body than is the case with
  the duller creatures occupying the lower branches of the Vertebrate
  stem.</p>

  <p><b>The Hair.</b>&mdash;The Mammalia are absolutely distinguished from
  all other Vertebrates (or, for the matter of that, Invertebrates) by the
  possession of hair. To define a mammal as a Vertebrate with hair would be
  an entirely exclusive definition; even in the smooth Whales a few hairs
  at least are present, which may be <!-- Page 7 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page7"></a>{7}</span>reduced to as few as two
  bristles on the lips. The term "hair," however, is apt to be somewhat
  loosely applied; it has been made use of to describe, for example, the
  slender processes of the chitinous skin of the Crustacea. It will be
  necessary, therefore, to enter into the microscopical structure and
  development of the mammalian hair. Hair is found in every mammal. The
  first appearance of a hair is a slight thickening of the stratum
  Malpighii of the epidermis, the cells taking part in this being <!-- Page
  8 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page8"></a>{8}</span>elongated and
  converging slightly above and below. Dr. Maurer has called attention to
  the remarkable likeness between the embryonic hair when at this stage and
  the simple sense-organs of lower Vertebrates. Later there is formed below
  this a denser aggregation of the corium, which ultimately becomes the
  papilla of the hair. This is the apparent homologue of the first formed
  part of a feather, which projects as a papilla before the epidermis has
  undergone any modification. Hence there is from the very first a
  difference between feathers and hairs&mdash;a difference which must be
  carefully borne in mind, especially when we consider the strong
  superficial resemblance between hairs and the simple barbless feathers.
  Still later the knob of epidermic cells becomes depressed into a tubular
  structure, which is lined with cells also derived from the stratum
  Malpighii, but is filled with a continuation of the more superficial
  cells of the epidermis. This is the hair-follicle, and from the epidermic
  cells arises the hair by direct metamorphosis of those cells; there is no
  excretion of the hair by the cells, but the cells become the hair. From
  the hair-follicle also grows out a pair of sebaceous glands, which serve
  to keep the fully-formed hair moist.</p>

  <p>Dr. Meijerle<a name="NtA_2" href="#Nt_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> has lately
  described in some detail the <!-- Page 9 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page9"></a>{9}</span>particular arrangement of the individual hairs
  among mammals; they are not by any manner of means scattered without
  order, but show a definite and regular arrangement, which varies with the
  animal. For instance, in an American Monkey (<i>Midas</i>), the hairs
  arise in threes&mdash;three hairs of equal size springing from the
  epidermis close together; in the Paca (<i>Coelogenys</i>) there are in
  each group three stout hairs alternating with three slender hairs. In
  some forms a number of hairs spring from a common point: in the Jerboa
  (<i>Dipus</i>) twelve or thirteen arise from a single hole; in <i>Ursus
  arctos</i> there is the same general plan, but there is one stout hair
  and four or five slender ones. There are numerous other complications and
  modifications, but the facts, although interesting, do not appear to
  throw any light upon the mutual affinities of the animals. Allied forms
  may have a very different arrangement, while in forms which have no near
  relationship the plan may be very similar, as is shown by the examples
  cited from Dr. Meijerle's paper. The groups of hairs, moreover, have
  themselves a definite placing, which the same anatomist has compared with
  the disposition of the bundles of hairs behind and between the scales of
  the Armadillo, and which has led him to the view that the ancestors of
  mammals were scaly creatures&mdash;a view also supported by Professor Max
  Weber,<a name="NtA_3" href="#Nt_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>and not in itself
  unreasonable when we consider the numerous points of affinity between the
  primitive Mammalia and certain extinct forms of reptiles.<a name="NtA_4"
  href="#Nt_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The hairs are greatly modified in form in different mammals and in
  different parts of their bodies. It is very commonly the case that a soft
  under-fur can be distinguished from the longer and coarser hairs, which
  to some extent hide the latter. Thus the "sealskin" of commerce is the
  under-fur of the <i>Otaria ursina</i> of the North. The coarser hairs may
  be further differentiated into bristles; these again into spines, such as
  those of the Hedgehog and of the Porcupine. Again, the flattening and
  agglutination of hairs seems to be responsible for the scales of the
  <i>Manis</i> <!-- Page 10 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page10"></a>{10}</span>and for the horns of the <i>Rhinoceros</i>.
  It is a matter of common knowledge that upon the head of various animals,
  <i>e.g.</i> the Domestic Cat, long and sensitive hairs are developed,
  which are connected with the terminations of nerves, and perform a
  sensory, probably tactile function. These occur on the snout, above the
  eyes, and in the neighbourhood of the ears. It is an interesting fact
  that a tuft of quite similar hairs occurs on the hand of many mammals
  close to the wrist, which, at least in the case of <i>Bassaricyon</i>,
  are connected with a strong branch from the arm-nerve. These tufts also
  occur in Lemurs, in the Cat, various Rodents and Marsupials, and are
  probably quite general in mammals who "feel" with their
  fore-limbs;&mdash;in which, in fact, the fore-limbs are not exclusively
  running organs. That the last remaining hairs of the Cetacea are found
  upon the muzzle, is perhaps significant of the importance of these
  sensory bristles. The entire absence of hairs is quite common in this
  order, although traces of them are sometimes found in the embryo. The
  Sirenia, too, are comparatively hairless, as are also many Ungulates.
  Whether the presence of blubber in the former case and the existence of a
  very thick skin in the latter animals are facts which have had anything
  to do with the disappearance of hair or not, is a matter for further
  inquiry.</p>

  <p>The intimate structure of the hair varies considerably. The variations
  concern the form of the hair, which may be round in transverse section,
  or so oval as to appear quite flat when the hair is examined in its
  entirety. The substance of the hair is made up of a central medulla or
  pith with a peripheral cortex; the latter is scaled, and the scales are
  often imbricated and with prominent edges. The amount of the two
  constituents also differs, and the cortex may be reduced to a series of
  bands surrounding only tracts of the enclosed pith. In the hair is
  contained the pigment to which the colour of mammals is chiefly due.
  Tracts of brightly-coloured skin may exist, as in the Apes of certain
  genera; but such structures are not general. The pigment of the hair
  seems to consist of those pigmentary substances known as melanins. It is
  remarkable to find such <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'an uniform'"
  >a uniform</span> cause of coloration, when we consider the great variety
  of feather-pigments found in birds. The variations of colour of the hair
  of mammals are due to the unequal distribution of these brown pigments.
  There are very few mammals which can <!-- Page 11 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page11"></a>{11}</span>be called brightly
  coloured. The Bats of the genus <i>Kerivoula</i> have been compared to
  large butterflies, and some of the Flying Squirrels have strongly-marked
  contrasts of reddish brown, white, and yellow. The same may be said of
  the spines of certain Porcupines. But we find in the hair no bright
  blues, greens, and reds such as are common among birds.</p>

  <p>There are certain general facts about the coloration of mammals which
  require some notice here. Next to the usually sombre hues of these
  animals the general absence of secondary sexual coloration is noteworthy.
  In but a few cases among the Lemurs and Bats do we find any marked
  divergences in hues between males and females. Secondary sexual
  characters in mammals are, it is true, often exhibited by the great
  length of certain hair-tracts in the male, such as the mane of the Lion,
  the throat- and leg-tufts of the Barbary Sheep, and so forth; but apart
  from these, the secondary sexual characters of mammals are chiefly shown
  in size, <i>e.g.</i> the Gorilla, or in the presence of tusks,
  <i>e.g.</i> various Boars, or of horns, as in the Deer, etc. The
  coloration of mammals frequently exhibits conspicuous patterns of
  marking. These are in the form of longitudinal stripes, of cross-stripes,
  or of spots; the latter may be "solid" spots, or broken up, as in the
  Leopard and Jaguar, into groups of smaller spots arranged in a
  rosette-fashion. We never find in mammals the complicated "eyes" and
  other markings which occur in so many birds and in other lower
  Vertebrates. It is important to note that in the Mammalia whose sense of
  sight is quite keen there should be a practical absence of secondary
  sexual colours. As to the relationship of the various forms of marking
  that do occur, it seems clear that there has been a progression from a
  striped or spotted condition to uniform coloration. For we find that many
  Deer have spotted young; that the young Tapir of the New World is
  spotted, while its parents are uniform blackish brown; the
  strongly-marked spotting of the young Puma contrasts with the uniform
  brown of the adult; and the Lion cub, as every one knows, is also
  spotted, the adult lioness showing considerable traces of the spots.</p>

  <p>The seasonal change in the colours of certain mammals is a subject
  upon which much has been written. The extreme of this is seen in those
  creatures, such as the Polar Hare and the Arctic Fox, which become
  entirely blanched in the winter, recovering <!-- Page 12 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page12"></a>{12}</span>their darker coat in the
  spring. This is, however, only an extreme case of a change which is
  general. Most animals get a thicker fur in winter and exchange it for a
  lighter one in summer. And the hues of the coat change in
  correspondence.</p>

  <p><b>Glands of the Skin.</b>&mdash;The great variety of integumental
  glands possessed by the Mammalia distinguishes them from any group of
  lower Vertebrates. This variability, however, only concerns the
  anatomical structure of the glands in question. Histologically they are
  all of them apparently to be referred to one of two types, the
  sudoriparous or sweat gland and the sebaceous gland. Simple sweat and
  sebaceous glands are abundant in mammals, with but a few exceptions. The
  structures that we are now concerned with are agglomerations of these
  glands. The mammary glands will be treated of in connexion with the
  marsupium; they are either masses of sweat glands, or of sebaceous glands
  whose secretion has been converted into milk.</p>

  <p>Many Carnivora possess glands opening to the exterior, near the anus,
  by a large orifice. These secrete various odoriferous substances, of
  which the well-known "civet" is an example. Other odoriferous glands are
  the musk glands of the Musk-deer and of the Beaver; the suborbital gland
  of many Antelopes; the dorsal gland of the Peccary, which has given the
  name of <i>Dicotyles</i> to the genus on account of its resemblance in
  form to a navel. This gland may be seen to secrete a clear watery fluid.
  The Elephant has a gland situated on the temple, which is said to secrete
  during certain periods only, and to be a warning to leave the animal
  alone. Very remarkable are the foot glands of certain species of
  <i>Rhinoceros</i>; they are not universally present in those animals, and
  are therefore useful as specific distinctions. On the back of the root of
  the tail in many Dogs are similar glands. The Gentle Lemur
  (<i>Hapalemur</i>) has a peculiar gland upon the arm, about the size of
  an almond, which in the male underlies a patch of spiny outgrowths. In
  <i>Lemur varius</i> is a hard patch of black skin which may be the
  remnants of such a gland. It is thought that the callosities on the legs
  of Horses and Asses are remnants of glands.</p>

  <p>One of the most complex of these structures which has been examined
  microscopically exists in the Marsupial <i>Myrmecobius</i>.<a
  name="NtA_5" href="#Nt_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> On the skin of the anterior
  part of the chest, just in front of the <!-- Page 13 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page13"></a>{13}</span>sternum, is a naked patch
  of skin which is seen to be perforated by numerous pores. Besides the
  ordinary sebaceous and sweat glands there are a series of masses of
  glands, opening by larger orifices, which present the appearance of
  groups of sebaceous glands, and are of a racemose character; but the
  existence of muscular fibres in their coats seems to show that they
  should be referred rather to the sudoriparous series. Beneath the
  integument is a large compound tubular gland quite half an inch in
  diameter.</p>

  <p>In <i>Didelphys dimidiata</i> there is a precisely similar glandular
  area and large underlying gland, the correspondence being remarkable in
  two Marsupials so distant in geographical position and affinities. Even
  among the Diprotodont genera there is something of the kind; for in
  <i>Dorcopsis luctuosa</i> and <i>D. muelleri</i> is a collection of four
  unusually large sebaceous follicles upon the throat, and in the Tree
  Kangaroo (<i>Dendrolagus bennettii</i>) there is the same collection of
  enlarged hair-follicles, though they are apparently somewhat reduced as
  compared with those of <i>Dorcopsis</i>. These are of course a few
  examples out of many.</p>

  <p>It seems to be possible that the functions of these various glands is
  at least twofold. In the first place, they may serve, where predominant
  in one sex, to attract the sexes together. In the second place, the
  glands may be useful to enable a strayed animal of a gregarious species
  to regain the herd. It is perfectly conceivable too that in other cases
  the glands may be a protection, as they most undoubtedly are in the
  Skunk, from attacks. In connexion with the first, and more especially the
  second, of the possible uses of these glands, it is interesting to note
  that in purely terrestrial creatures, such as the Rhinoceros, the glands
  are situated on the feet, and would therefore taint the grass and herbage
  as the animal passed, and thus leave a track for the benefit of its mate.
  The same may be said of the rudimentary glands of Horses if they are
  really glands. The secretion of the "crumen" of Antelopes is sometimes
  deposited deliberately by <i>Oreotragus</i> upon surrounding objects, a
  proceeding which would attain the same end. One may even perhaps detect
  "mimicry" in the similar odours of certain animals. Prey may be lured to
  their destruction, or enemies frightened away. The defenceless Musk-deer
  may escape its foes by the suggestion of the musky odour of a crocodile.
  It is at any rate perfectly conceivable that the variety of odours among
  mammals may play a very <!-- Page 14 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page14"></a>{14}</span>important part in their life, and it is
  perhaps worthy of note that birds with highly-variegated plumage are
  provided only with the uropygial gland, while mammals with usually dull
  and similar coloration have a great variety of skin glands. Scent is no
  doubt a sense of higher importance in mammals than in birds. The subject
  is one which will bear further study.</p>

  <p><b>Nails and Claws.</b>&mdash;Except for the Cetacea (where rudiments
  have been found in the foetus), the extremities of the fingers and of the
  toes of mammals are covered by, or encased in, horny epidermic plates,
  known as nails, claws, and hoofs.</p>

  <p>The variety in the shape and development of these corneous sheaths to
  the digits is highly characteristic of mammals as opposed to lower
  Vertebrates. If we take extreme cases, such as the nail of the thumb in
  Man, the hoof of a Horse, and the claw of a Cat, it is easy to
  distinguish the three kinds of phalangeal horny coverings. But the
  differences become extinguished as we pass from these to related types.
  The nail of the little finger in Man approaches the claw-like form; and
  the hoofs of the Lama are almost claws in the sharpness of their
  extremities. On the whole it may be said that claws and hoofs embrace the
  bone which they cover, while nails lie only upon its dorsal surface. The
  form of the distal phalanx which bears the nail shows, however, two kinds
  of modification which do not support such a classification. When those
  phalanges are clad with hoofs or covered by a nail they end in a rounded
  and flattened termination. On the other hand, when they bear a claw they
  are themselves sharpened at the extremity and often grooved above.</p>

  <p><b>The Marsupium.</b>&mdash;It may appear to be unnecessary at this
  juncture to speak of the marsupial pouch, which is so usually believed to
  be a characteristic of the group Marsupialia. Rudiments of this structure
  have, however, been recently discovered in the higher mammals, and, as
  Dr. Klaatsch<a name="NtA_6" href="#Nt_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> has remarked,
  all researches into the "history of the mammals culminate in the question
  whether the placental mammals pass through a marsupial stage or not." We
  cannot, therefore, look upon the marsupial pouch as a matter affecting
  only the Marsupials, though it is true that this organ is at present
  functional only in them and in the Monotremata. <!-- Page 15 --><span

Anatomy</i>, after W. Haacke.)</p>

  <p>In the Marsupials the pouch shelters the young, which are born in an
  exceedingly imperfect state, minute, nude, and blind, with a "larval"
  mouth fitted only to grasp in a permanent fashion the teat, upon which
  they are carefully fixed by the parent. But even later the pouch is made
  use of as a temporary harbour of refuge: from the pouch of female
  Kangaroos at the Zoological Gardens may frequently be observed to
  protrude the tail and hind-legs of a young Kangaroo as big as a Cat, and
  perfectly well able to take care of itself.</p>

  <p>In the Monotremata (in <i>Echidna</i>) there is a deep fold of the
  skin which lodges the unhatched egg, and into which the mammary glands
  open, one on either side. This structure is only periodically developed,
  and arises from two rudiments, one corresponding to each mammary area;
  but in the female with eggs or young there is but a single deep
  depression, which occupies the same region of the body as the marsupial
  pouch of the <!-- Page 16 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page16"></a>{16}</span>Marsupials.<a name="NtA_7"
  href="#Nt_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> It is usually held that this structure is
  not of precisely the same morphological value as the pouch of the
  Marsupial; and the difference is expressed by terming the one (that of
  <i>Echidna</i>) the mammary pouch, and the other the marsupium. At first
  sight it may appear to be an unnecessary refinement to separate two
  structures which have so many and such obvious likenesses. It is not
  quite certain, however, that the difference is not even more profound
  than later opinions seem to indicate. The Monotremata not only have no
  teats, as has already been pointed out, but the mammary glands themselves
  are of a perfectly different nature to those of the higher mammals,
  including the Marsupials. There is therefore no <i>a&nbsp;priori</i> objection
  to the view that the accessory parts developed in connexion with the
  mammary glands should also be different. The teat of the higher Mammalia
  grows up round the area upon which the ducts of the mammary glands open;
  it is a fold of skin which eventually assumes the cylindrical form of the
  adult teat, and which includes the ducts of the milk glands. It has been
  suggested that the two folds of skin which form the mammary pouch of
  <i>Echidna</i> are to be looked upon as the equivalent of the commencing
  teat of the higher mammal.<a name="NtA_8" href="#Nt_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>
  In this case it is clear that the marsupial folds of the Marsupial cannot
  correspond accurately with the apparently similar folds of
  <i>Echidna</i>, because there are teats as well. It is the teats which
  correspond to the marsupial folds of <i>Echidna</i>. This view is in
  apparent contradiction to an interesting discovery in a specimen of a
  Phalanger by Dr. Klaatsch.<a name="NtA_9" href="#Nt_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>
  This Marsupial, like most others, has a well-developed marsupial pouch,
  in which the young are lodged at birth; but round two of the teats is
  another distinct fold on either side, the outer wall of which forms the
  general wall of the pouch. Dr. Klaatsch thinks that these smaller and
  included pouches are the equivalents of the mammary pouches of
  <i>Echidna</i>. They contain teats, but this comparison does not do away
  with the validity of Gegenbaur's suggestion already referred to, because
  the teats are (see above) <!-- Page 17 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page17"></a>{17}</span>secondary. If this fact be fairly to be
  interpreted in the sense which Dr. Klaatsch attaches to it, we have an
  interesting case of the growth of a new organ out of and partly replacing
  an old organ. In the Monotremes there is a pouch which facilitates or
  performs both nutritive and protective functions; in the Phalanger these
  two functions are carried on in separate pouches; finally, in other
  Marsupials, there is a return to the undifferentiated state of affairs
  found in the Monotremata, but with the help of a new organ not found in
  them.</p>

  <p>Though so characteristic of Marsupials, the marsupial pouch is not
  always developed in them. It is present in all the Kangaroos, Wallabies,
  and Wombats, in fact in the Diprotodonts. It is also present in a number
  of the carnivorous Polyprotodont Marsupials; but in <i>Phascologale</i>
  it is only present in rudiment, and in <i>Myrmecobius</i> it is entirely
  obsolete. In the American Opossums the state of the pouch is variable.
  "Generally absent, sometimes merely composed of two lateral folds of skin
  separate at each end, rarely complete," is Mr. Thomas' summary in his
  definition of the family Didelphyidae.<a name="NtA_10"
  href="#Nt_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> Another curious feature of the pouch in
  the Marsupials is the variability in the position of the mouth of the
  pouch: in all the Diprotodonts it looks forward; but in many
  Polyprotodonts it looks backward. This, however, has some connexion with
  the habitual attitude of the possessor: in the Kangaroo, leaping along on
  its hind-legs, it is requisite that the pouch should open forwards; but
  in the dog-like Thylacine, going on all fours, the fact that the pouch
  <!-- Page 18 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page18"></a>{18}</span>opens backwards is less disadvantageous to
  the contained young.</p>

  <p>The male Thylacine has a pouch which is quite or very nearly as well
  formed as in the female. There are also rudiments of a pouch in the male
  foetuses of many Marsupials, especially of those belonging to the
  Polyprotodont section of the order, though these rudiments are by no
  means confined to that subdivision. Up to so late a period as the age of
  four months (length 19.8 cm.) the male <i>Dasyurus ursinus</i> has a
  pouch.</p>

  <p>We have now to consider the interesting series of facts relative to
  the permanence&mdash;in a rudimentary condition it is true&mdash;of the
  mammary pouch in the higher Mammalia, facts which seem to be an
  additional proof that they have been derived from an ancestor in which
  the pouch was an organ of functional importance. The first definite proof
  of the occurrence of a pouch in any mammal not a Marsupial or a Monotreme
  was made by Malkmus, who found this structure in a Sheep. It seems,
  however, that the structures found in the higher mammals are not always
  comparable to the marsupium of the Marsupials, but sometimes to the
  mammary pouch of the Monotreme. That the Marsupials are a side line, and
  not involved in the ancestry of the Eutheria, is an opinion which is at
  present widely held. At the same time it is reasonable to suppose that
  the original stock lying between the Prototheria and the Metatheria,
  whence the latter and the Eutheria have arisen, preserved both the
  mammary pouch of the lower mammal and the marsupium of the
  further-developed stage, as does <i>Phalangista</i> occasionally at the
  present day. Hence to find remnants of both structures in existing
  mammals would not so incredible. This is what Dr. Klaatsch believes to be
  the case. In certain Ungulates, including two species of Antelope, Dr.
  Klaatsch found very considerable rudiments of folds provided with
  unstriated muscular fibre; there were in the adult <i>Cervicapra
  isabellina</i> a pair of pouches, one on each side, and a rudiment of a
  second on either side; possibly this multiplication of the pouches has
  relation to the number of young. That there is more than one pouch makes
  a comparison with the mammary pouch rather than with the marsupium
  probable. The Ungulate teat, it must be remembered (see p. <a
  href="#page16">16</a>), is a secondary teat; hence there is no difficulty
  in the comparison from this point of view. A pouch containing a primary
  <!-- Page 19 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page19"></a>{19}</span>teat would of course be absolutely
  incomparable with a mammary pouch, because in that case the wall of the
  teat itself would be the pouch.</p>

  <p>Mammals belonging to quite different Orders show traces more or less
  marked of a marsupium. In young Dogs the teats are borne upon an area
  where the skin is thinner, the covering of hair less dense than
  elsewhere&mdash;all points of resemblance to the inside of the pouch of a
  Marsupial; in addition to this there are traces of the sphincter marsupii
  muscle. In other Carnivora there are similar vestiges. In <i>Lemur
  catta</i> a more complete rudiment of a marsupial pouch is to be met
  with. In this Lemur the teats are both inguinal and pectoral; the skin in
  these regions is thin and but slightly hairy, and extends forwards as two
  bands of the same thinness and smoothness on each side of the densely
  hairy skin covering the sternum. This area is sharply separated from the
  rest of the integument by a fold which runs parallel to the longitudinal
  axis of the body, and can be comparable with nothing save the rudiment of
  the marsupial fold.</p>

  <p>One is tempted to wonder how far the habit which certain Lemurs have
  of carrying their young across the abdomen with the tail wrapped round
  the body of the mother is a reminiscence of a marsupial pouch.</p>

<h5><b>Skeleton.</b></h5>

  <p>The skeleton of the Mammalia consists almost solely of the
  endoskeleton. It is only among the Edentata that an exoskeleton of bony
  plates in the skin is met with. As in other Vertebrates, the skeleton is
  divisible into an axial portion, the skull and vertebral column, and an
  appendicular skeleton, that of the limbs. The bones of mammals are well
  ossified, and in the adult there are but few and small tracts of
  cartilage left.</p>

  <p><b>Vertebral Column.</b>&mdash;The vertebral column of the mammals,
  like that of the higher Vertebrata, consists of a number of separate and
  fully-ossified vertebrae.</p>

  <p>The constitution of a vertebra upon which all the usual processes are
  marked is as follows<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span>There is first of all
  the body or centrum of the vertebra, a massive piece of bone shaped like
  a disc or a cylinder. The centra of contiguous vertebrae <!-- Page 20
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page20"></a>{20}</span>are separated by
  a certain amount of fibrous tissue forming the intervertebral disc, and
  the apposed surfaces of the centra are as a rule nearly flat. In this
  last feature, and in the important fact that the centra are ossified from
  three distinct centres, the anterior and posterior pieces ("epiphyses")
  remaining distinct for a time, even for a long time (as in the Whales),
  the centra in the mammals differ from those of reptiles and birds. The
  epiphyses are not found throughout the vertebral column of the
  lowly-organised Monotremata, and they do not appear to exist in the
  Sirenia.</p>

  <p>From each side of the centrum on the dorsal side arises a process of
  bone which meets its fellow in the middle line above, and is from there
  often prolonged into a spine. A canal is thus formed which lodges the
  spinal cord. This arch of bone is known as the neural arch, and the
  dorsal process of the same as the spinous process. The sides of the
  neural arch bear oval facets, by which successive vertebrae articulate
  with one another: those situated anteriorly are the anterior
  zygapophyses, while those on the posterior aspect of the arch are the
  posterior zygapophyses; these articular facets do not exist in the
  tail-region of many mammals, <i>e.g.</i> Whales.</p>

  <p>In addition to the dorsal median spinous process of the <!-- Page 21
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page21"></a>{21}</span>vertebra there
  may be a ventral median process, arising of course from the centrum,
  termed the hypapophysis.</p>

  <p>From the sides of the neural arch, or from the centrum itself, there
  is commonly a longer or shorter process on each side, known as the
  transverse process. This is sometimes formed of two distinct processes,
  one above the other; in such cases the upper part is called a
  diapophysis, the lower a parapophysis.</p>

  <p>The neural arch may also bear other lateral processes, of which one
  directed forwards is the metapophysis, the other directed backwards the
  anapophysis.</p>

  <p>The series of bones which constitute the vertebral column can be
  divided into regions. It is possible to recognise cervical, dorsal,
  lumbar, sacral, and caudal vertebrae. In the case of animals with only
  rudimentary hind-limbs, such as the Whales, there is no recognisable
  sacral region. The neck or cervical vertebrae are nearly always seven in
  number. The well-known exceptions are the Manatee, where there are six,
  and certain Sloths, where there are six, eight, or nine. These rare
  exceptions only accentuate the very remarkable constancy in number, which
  is very distinctive of the mammals as compared with lower Vertebrata.
  There are of course abnormalities, the last cervical, and sometimes the
  last two, assuming the characters of the ensuing dorsals, by developing a
  more or less complete rib. There are also recorded examples of
  <i>Bradypus</i>, in which the number of cervicals is increased to ten.
  The characteristics, then, of the cervical vertebrae are, in the first
  place, that they do not normally bear free ribs, and that there is a
  break as a rule between the last cervical and the first dorsal on this
  account. In birds, for example, the cervicals, differing in number in
  different families and genera, gradually approach the dorsals by the
  gradually lengthening ribs. The transverse processes of the vertebrae are
  commonly perforated by a canal for the vertebral artery, and are bifid at
  their extremities. In some Ungulates these vertebrae, moreover,
  approximate to the vertebrae of lower Vertebrata in the fact that there
  are ball and socket joints between the centra, instead of only the
  fibrous discs of the remaining vertebrae.</p>

  <p>The first two vertebrae of the series are always very different from
  those which follow. The first is termed the <!-- Page 22 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page22"></a>{22}</span>atlas, and articulates
  with the skull. The most remarkable fact about this bone (shared,
  however, by lower Vertebrates) is that its centrum is detached from it
  and attached to the next vertebra, in connexion with which it will be
  referred to immediately. The whole bone thus gets a ring-like form, and
  the salient processes of other vertebrae are but little developed, with
  the exception of the transverse processes, which are wide and wing-like.
  In many Marsupials, such as the Wombat and Kangaroo, the arch of the
  atlas is open below, there being no centre of ossification. In others,
  such as <i>Thylacinus</i>, there is a distinct nodule of bone in this
  situation not concrescent with the rest of the arch.</p>

  <p>The dorsal vertebrae vary greatly in number: nine (<i>Hyperoodon</i>)
  seems to be the lowest number existing normally; while there may be as
  many as nineteen, as in <i>Centetes</i>, or twenty-two, as in
  <i>Hyrax</i>. These vertebrae are to be defined by the fact that they
  carry ribs, and the first one or two lumbars are often "converted into"
  dorsals by the appearance of a small supernumerary rib. The spinous
  processes of these vertebrae are commonly long, and sometimes very long.
  It is only among the Glyptodons that any of these vertebrae are fused
  together into a mass.</p>

  <p>The lumbar vertebrae, which follow the dorsal, vary greatly in number.
  There are as few as two in the whale <i>Neobalaena</i>, as many as
  seventeen in <i>Tursiops</i>; this group, the Cetacea, contains the
  extremes. Nine lumbars are found in the Lemurs <i>Indris</i> and
  <i>Loris</i>. As a rule the number of lumbars is to some extent dependent
  upon that of the dorsals. It often happens that the number of
  thoraco-lumbar vertebrae is constant for a given group. Thus the
  Artiodactyles have nineteen of these vertebrae, and the Perissodactyles
  as a rule twenty-three. A greater number of dorsals implies a smaller
  number of lumbars, and of course <i>vice versa</i>. The existence of a
  sacral region formed of a <!-- Page 24 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page24"></a>{24}</span>number of vertebrae fused together and
  supported by the pelvic girdle is characteristic of the mammals, but is
  not found in the Cetacea and the Sirenia, where functional hind-limbs are
  wanting. Strictly speaking, the sacrum is limited to the two or three
  vertebrae whose expanded transverse processes meet the ilia. But to these
  are or may be added a variable number of vertebrae withdrawn from both
  the lumbar and the caudal series, which unite with each other to form the
  massive piece of bone which constitutes the sacrum of the adult.</p>

  <p>The caudal vertebrae complete the series. They begin in as fully
  developed a condition as the lumbars, with well-marked transverse
  processes, etc.; but they end as no more than centra, from which
  sometimes tiny outgrowths represent in a rudimentary way the neural
  arches, etc. Very often the caudal vertebrae are furnished with ventral,

  <p><b>The Skull.</b>&mdash;The skull in the Mammalia differs from that of
  the lower Vertebrata in a number of important features, which will be
  enumerated in the following brief sketch of its structure. In the first
  place, the skull is a more consolidated whole than in reptiles; the
  number of elements entering into its formation is less, and they are on
  the whole more firmly welded together than in Vertebrates standing below
  the Mammalia in the series. Thus in the cranial region the post- and
  pre-frontals, the post-orbitals and the supra-orbitals have disappeared,
  though now and again we are reminded of their occurrence in the ancestors
  of the Mammalia by a separate ossification corresponding to some of the
  bones. Nowhere is this consolidation seen with greater clearness than in
  the lower jaw. That bone, or rather each half of it, is in mammals formed
  of one bone, the dentary (to which occasionally, as it appears, a
  separate mento-Meckelian <!-- Page 26 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page26"></a>{26}</span>ossification may be added). The angular,
  splenial, and all the other elements of the reptilian jaw have vanished,
  though the numerous points from which the mammalian dentary ossifies is a
  reminiscence of a former state of affairs; and here again an occasional
  continuance of the separation is preserved, as the case observed by
  Professor Albrecht of a separate supra-angular bone in a Rorqual attests.
  Among other reptilian bones that are not to be found in the mammalian
  skull are the basipterygoids, quadrato-jugal, and supratemporal. A few of
  these bones, however, though no longer traceable in the adult skull save
  in cases of what we term abnormalities, do find their representatives in
  the foetal skull. Professor Parker, for example, has described a
  supra-orbital in the embryo Hedgehog; a supratemporal also appears to be
  occasionally independent.</p>

  <p>In the mode of the articulation of the lower jaw to the skull the
  Mammalia apparently, perhaps really, differ from other Vertebrates. In
  the Amphibia and Reptilia, with which groups alone any comparisons are
  profitable, the lower jaw articulates by means of a quadrate bone, which
  may be movably or firmly attached to the skull. In the mammals the
  articulation of the lower jaw is with the squamosal. The nature of this
  articulation is one of the most debated points in comparative anatomy.
  Seeing that Professor Kingsley<a name="NtA_13"
  href="#Nt_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> in the most recent contribution to the
  subject quotes no less than fifty-two different views, many of which are
  more or less convergent, it will be obvious that in a work like the
  present the matter cannot be treated exhaustively. As, however, Professor
  Kingsley justly says that "no single bone occupies a more important
  position in the discussion of the origin of the Mammalia than does the
  quadrate," and with equal justice adds that "upon the answer given as to
  its fate in this group depends, in large measure, the broader problem of
  the phylogeny of the Mammalia," it becomes, or indeed has long been, a
  matter which cannot be ignored in any work dealing with the mammals. A
  simple view, due to the late Dr. Baur and to Professor Dollo, commends
  itself at first sight as meeting the case. The last-named author holds,
  or held, that in all the higher Vertebrates it is at least on
  <i>a&nbsp;priori</i> grounds likely that two such characteristically
  vertebrate features as the lower jaw and the chain of bones bringing the
  outer world <!-- Page 27 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page27"></a>{27}</span>into communication with the internal organ
  of hearing would be homologous throughout the series. He believed,
  therefore, that the entire chain of ossicula auditus in the mammal is
  equal to the columella of the reptile, since their relations are the same
  to the tympanum on the one hand and to the foramen ovale on the other;
  and that the lower jaw articulates in the same way in both. It follows,
  therefore, that the glenoid part of the squamosal must be the quadrate
  which has become ankylosed with it after the fashion of concentration in
  the mammalian skull that has already been referred to. The fact that
  occasionally the glenoid part of the squamosal is a separate bone<a
  name="NtA_14" href="#Nt_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> appeared to confirm this
  way of looking at the <!-- Page 28 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page28"></a>{28}</span>matter. But the hall-mark of truth is not
  always simplicity; indeed the converse appears to be frequently the case.
  And on the whole this view does not commend itself to zoologists at
  present. For it must be borne in mind that the lower jaw of the mammal is
  not the precise equivalent of that of the reptiles. Apart from the
  membrane bones, which may be collectively the equivalents of the dentary
  of the mammal, there is the cartilaginous articular bone to be
  considered, which forms the connexion between the rest of the jaw and the
  quadrate in reptiles. Even in the Anomodontia, whose relations to the
  Mammalia are considered elsewhere, there is this bone. But in these
  reptiles the articular bone articulates not only with the quadrate, but
  also to a large extent with the squamosal, the quadrate shrinking in size
  and developing processes which give to it very much the look of either
  the incus or the malleus of the mammalian ear. In fact it seems on the
  whole to fit in with the views of the majority, as well as with a fair
  interpretation of the facts of embryology, to consider that the chain of
  ear bones in the mammal is not the equivalent of the columella of the
  reptile, but that the stapes of the mammal is the columella, and that the
  articulare is represented by the malleus and the quadrate by the incus.
  It is very interesting to note this entire change of function in the
  bones in question. Bones which in the reptile serve as a means of
  attachment of the lower jaw to the skull are used in the mammal to convey
  the waves of sound from the tympanum of the ear to the internal organ of
  hearing.</p>

  <p>Another important and diagnostic feature in the mammalian skull is
  that the first vertebra of the vertebral column always articulates with
  two separate occipital condyles, which are borne by the exoccipital bones
  and formed mainly though not entirely by them. Certain Anomodontia form
  the nearest approach to the mammals in this particular. The two condyles
  of Amphibia are purely exoccipital in origin.</p>

  <p>In the Mammalia, unlike what is found in lower Vertebrates (but here
  again the Anomodontia form at least a partial exception), the jugal arch
  does not connect the face with the quadrate, for, as already said, that
  bone does not exist, in the Sauropsidan form, in mammals. This arch
  passes from the squamosal to the maxillary, and has but one separate bone
  in addition to those two, viz. the jugal or malar. <!-- Page 29 --><span

  <p>In connexion with the elaboration of the chain of auditory ossicles it
  is very usual for mammals to possess a thin inflated bone, sometimes
  partly or entirely formed out of the tympanic bone, and known as the
  tympanic bulla. Whether this structure is thin and inflated or thick and
  depressed in form it is characteristic of the mammals, and does not occur
  below them in the series. But it is not present in all mammals. It is
  absent, for example, in the Monotremes. When it is present it is
  sometimes formed from other bones, as, for instance, from the
  alisphenoids. The tympanic ring has been held to be the equivalent of the
  quadrate. It is more probably the quadrato-jugal.<a name="NtA_15"

  <p><b>Ribs.</b>&mdash;All mammals are furnished with ribs, of which the
  number of pairs differs considerably from group to group, or it may be
  even from species to species. The ribs are attached as a rule by two
  heads, of which one, the capitulum, arises as a rule between two centra
  of successive vertebrae. The other, the tuberculum, springs from the
  transverse process. Only in the Monotremes <!-- Page 30 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page30"></a>{30}</span>are there ribs with but
  one, the capitular, head. In the posterior part of the series the two
  heads often gradually coalesce, so that there comes to be but one, the
  capitular, head. The Whales also, at least the Whalebone Whales, are
  exceptional in possessing but one head to the ribs, which is the
  capitular. The first rib joins the sternum below, and a variable number
  after this have the same attachment. There are always a number of ribs,
  sometimes called floating ribs, which have no sternal attachment. In the
  Whalebone Whales it is the first rib alone which is so attached. As a
  rule, to which the Whales mentioned are again an exception, the rib is
  divided into at least two regions&mdash;the vertebral portion which is
  always ossified, and the sternal moiety which is usually cartilaginous.
  This is, however, often very short in the first rib. They are, however,
  ossified in the Armadillos and in some other animals. Between the
  vertebral and sternal portions an intermediate tract is separated off and
  ossified in the Monotremata. The ribs of existing mammals belong only to
  the dorsal region of the vertebral column, but there are traces of lumbar
  ribs and also of cervical ribs. In the Monotremata, indeed, these latter
  <!-- Page 31 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page31"></a>{31}</span>are
  persistently free for a very long period, and in some cases never become
  ankylosed with their vertebrae. But it should be noted that in this group
  there is no approximation to the state of affairs which exists in many
  lower Vertebrates, where there is a gradual transition between the ribs
  of the cervical and those of the dorsal region of the vertebral column;
  for that of the seventh ribs in Monotremes is smaller than those which
  precede it.</p>

  <p><b>The Sternum.</b>&mdash;All the Mammalia so far as is known possess
  a sternum. This is the bone, or series of bones (sternebrae), which lies
  upon the ventral surface of the chest, and to which the ribs are attached
  below. The development of the sternum has been shown to take place from
  the fusion of the ribs below into two lateral bands, one on each side;
  the approximation of these bands forms the single and unpaired sternum of
  most mammals. Very considerable traces, however, of the paired state of
  the sternal bones often exist; thus in the Sperm Whale the first piece of
  the sternum is divided into two by a longitudinal division, and the
  second piece is longitudinally grooved. The development of the sternum
  out of the fused ends of ribs is shown in a more complete condition in
  some <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'specis'"
  >species</span> of <i>Manis</i> than in many other mammals. Thus in <i>M.
  tricuspis</i> the last ribs of those which are attached to the sternum
  are completely fused together into a single piece on each side.<a
  name="NtA_16" href="#Nt_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> As a general rule the
  last ribs which come into relation with the sternum do so only in an
  imperfect way, being simply firmly attached at their sides to, but not
  fused with, the last ribs which are definitely articulated with the
  sternum. Contrary to what is found in lower <!-- Page 32 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page32"></a>{32}</span>Vertebrates, the sternum
  of the Mammalia consists of a series of pieces, as many as eight or nine
  or even sixteen in <i>Choloepus</i>, of which the first is called the
  manubrium sterni, and the last the ensiform cartilage, xiphisternum, or
  xiphoid process. The latter often remains largely cartilaginous
  throughout life; in fact this is generally but not universally the case
  with that part of the breastbone. The most extraordinary modification of
  the xiphoid process is seen in the African species of the genus
  <i>Manis</i>, where it diverges into two long cartilages, which run back
  to the pelvis and then, curving round, run forwards and fuse together in
  the middle line anteriorly. These processes serve for the attachment of
  certain tongue-muscles. They were looked upon by Professor Parker as the
  equivalents of the "abdominal ribs" of reptiles elsewhere non-existent
  among mammals. This view is not, however, usually held. The manubrium
  sterni is often keeled in the middle line below; this is so with the
  Bats, which thus approach the birds, and probably for the same reason,
  i.e. the need of an enlarged origin for the pectoral muscle, which is
  concerned in the movements of flight. In many forms this part of the
  sternum is much broader than the pieces which follow; this is so with the
  Viscacha. In the Pig the precise reverse is seen, the manubrium being
  narrower than the rest of the sternal bonelets. It will be noticed,
  however, that in this and similar cases there are no clavicles. Ribs are
  attached between the successive pieces of the sternum. When the sternum
  is reduced, as it is in the Cetacea and in the Sirenia, it is the
  intermediate part of the series of bones which becomes abbreviated or
  vanishes. The Sperm Whale has only a manubrium sterni and a following
  piece belonging to the mesosternum. It is fair to say that the xiphoid
  process and the rest of the sternum have disappeared, since among the
  Toothed Whales a progressive shortening of the sternum can be seen. In
  the Whalebone Whales the sternum is still further reduced; the manubrium
  is alone left, and to it are attached but a single pair of ribs. In
  <i>Balaena</i>, however, a rudimentary <!-- Page 33 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page33"></a>{33}</span>piece, apparently
  comparable to a xiphoid process, has been detected.</p>

  <p>From the instances which have been described, as well as from the mode
  of development of the sternum and from the number of free ribs,
  <i>i.e.</i> ribs which are not attached to it, it would seem that the
  sternum has undergone a considerable reduction in its size. This
  reduction may be possibly accounted for by the need for respiratory
  activity, which is clearly increased by a less-marked fixity of the walls
  of the thoracic cavity. In the case of the Whales one can hardly help
  coming to that conclusion. The arrangement in the Monotremata does not,
  however, point in the same direction; for these animals are precisely
  like the higher Mammalia in the reduction of the sternum and of the
  number of ribs which reach it.</p>

  <p><b>The Episternum.</b>&mdash;The Mammalia are as a rule to be
  distinguished from lower Vertebrates by the absence of an episternum, or
  interclavicle as it is also called. In the Monotremata, however, there is
  a large <img src="images/t.png" class="middle" style="height:2ex;" alt="T"
  />-shaped bone which does not overlie the sternum as in reptiles, but is
  anterior to it. The relations of this bone to the clavicles seem to leave
  no doubt that it is the equivalent of the Lacertilian interclavicle or
  episternum. The Monotremata are not, however, the only mammals in which
  this structure is to be seen. The Mole in the embryonic condition is <!--
  Page 34 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page34"></a>{34}</span>provided
  with pieces of bone which overlie the manubrium sterni and are attached
  to the clavicles, and are no doubt to be regarded as the same structure.
  Probably in many mammals the manubrium will be found to be partly made up
  of corresponding rudiments. In any case, vestiges of an episternum in the
  shape of two minute ossicles have been discovered in Man, lying in front
  of the manubrium. They have been termed ossa suprasternalia. In Man and
  in the Mole the paired nature of the episternum is clearly apparent. It
  has been suggested that this structure in its entirety belongs to the
  clavicles, just as the sternum belongs to the ribs; <i>i.e.</i> that it
  formed out of the approximated and fused ends of the clavicles. Dr.
  Mivart<a name="NtA_17" href="#Nt_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> figured a good
  many years since a pair of ossicles in <i>Mycetes</i>, lying in one case
  between the ends of the clavicles and the manubrium sterni, and in
  another example anterior to the ventral ends of the clavicles. Gegenbaur
  has figured a <!-- Page 35 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page35"></a>{35}</span>pair of similar bones in the Hamster.<a
  name="NtA_18" href="#Nt_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> It is possible that these
  are to be referred to the same category. It has also been suggested that
  these supposed episternal rudiments are the vestiges of a pair of
  cervical ribs.</p>

  <p><b>The Pectoral Girdle.</b>&mdash;The skeleton by which the fore-limb
  is connected with the trunk is known as the Pectoral Girdle. The main
  part of this girdle is formed by the large scapula, or blade-bone as it
  is often termed. The coracoidal elements will be dealt with later. The
  scapula is not firmly connected with the backbone; it is attached merely
  by muscles, thus presenting a great difference from the corresponding
  pelvic girdle. The reason for this difference is not easy to understand.
  On the one hand it may be pointed out that in all running animals at any
  rate there is a greater need for the fixation in a particularly firm way
  of the hind-limbs; but, again, in the climbing creatures both limbs
  would, one might suppose, be bettered by a firm fixation. It must be
  remembered, however, that in the latter case the same result is at least
  partly brought about by a well-developed clavicle, which fixes the girdle
  to the sternum and so to the vertebral column by means of the ribs.</p>

  <p>Broadly speaking, too, the fore-limbs require a greater freedom and
  variety of movement than the hind-limbs, which are supports <!-- Page 36

  push along the rapidly-moving body. Stronger fixation is therefore a

  <p>The shoulder-blade of mammals is as a rule a much-flattened bone with
  a ridge on the outer surface known as the spine; this ridge ends in a
  freely-projecting process, the acromion, from which a branch often arises
  known as the metacromion. This gives a bifurcate appearance to the end of
  the ridge. The spine is less developed and the scapula is narrower in
  such animals as the Dog and the Deer which simply run, and whose
  fore-limbs therefore are not endowed with the complexity of movement
  seen, for instance, in the Apes.</p>

  <p>It has been pointed out that the area which lies in front of the
  spine, the prescapular lamina, is most extensively developed in such
  animals as perform complex movements with the fore-limbs. The Sea Lion
  and the Great Anteater are cited by Professor G. B. Howes as examples of
  this preponderance of the anterior portion of the scapula over that which
  lies behind the spine. The general shape of the scapula varies
  considerably among the different orders of mammals; but it always
  presents the characters mentioned, which are nowhere seen among the
  Sauropsida except among certain Anomodonts, which will be duly referred
  to (see p. <a href="#page90">90</a>). The most conspicuous divergences
  from the normal are to be found in the Cetacea and the Monotremata. In
  the former the acromion is approximated so nearly to the anterior border
  of the blade-bone that the prescapular fossa is reduced to a very small
  area; and in <i>Platanista</i> the acromion actually coincides with the
  anterior border, so that that fossa actually disappears. In the Whales,
  too, the scapula is as a rule very broad, especially above; it has
  frequently a fan-like contour. In the Monotremata the acromion also
  coincides with the anterior border of the scapula; but the sameness of
  appearance which it thus presents (in this feature) to the Cetacean
  scapula is <!-- Page 38 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page38"></a>{38}</span>apparently not due to real resemblance. What
  has happened in the Monotremata is, that the prescapular fossa is so
  enormously expanded that it occupies the whole of the inner side of the
  blade-bone, while the subscapular fossa which, so to speak, should occupy
  that situation, has been thus pushed round to the front, where it is
  divided from the postscapular fossa by a slight ridge only.</p>

  <p>The clavicle is a bone which varies much in mammals. It is sometimes
  indeed, as in the Ungulata, entirely absent; in other forms it shows
  varying degrees of retrocession in importance; it is only in climbing,
  burrowing, digging, and flying mammals that it is really well
  developed.</p>

  <p>In the higher Mammalia the coracoid<a name="NtA_19"
  href="#Nt_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> is present, but does not reach the
  sternum as in the Monotremata. It is known to human anatomists as the
  coracoid process of the scapula. It has been found, however, by Professor
  Howes<a name="NtA_20" href="#Nt_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> and others, that
  this process really consists of two separate centres of ossification,
  forming two separate bonelets, which in the adult become firmly ankylosed
  to each other and to the scapula. These two separate bones have been met
  with in the embryo of <i>Lepus, Sciurus</i>, and the young of various
  other mammals belonging to very diverse orders, such as Edentates and
  Primates. The separation even occasionally persists in the adult. The
  question is, What is the relation of these bonelets to the coracoid of
  the Monotremata and to the corresponding regions of reptiles? Professor
  Howes terms the lower patch of bone the metacoracoid and the upper the
  epicoracoid; <!-- Page 39 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page39"></a>{39}</span>the former is alone concerned with the
  glenoid cavity. It must therefore, one would suppose, correspond to the
  "coracoid" of the Monotremata, while the upper piece of bone is the
  epicoracoid process of that mammal. The Mammalia, therefore, higher as
  well as lower, differ from the reptiles in that the coracoid is formed of
  two bones, the exceptions being, among some other extinct forms, certain
  of the Anomodontia, a group which it will be recollected is the nearest
  of all reptiles to the mammals.</p>

(From Wiedersheim's
<i>Anatomy of Man</i>.)</p>

  <p><b>The Fore-limb.</b>&mdash;The humerus is of varying length among
  mammals. A feature which it sometimes shares with the humerus of lower
  forms is the presence of an entepicondylar foramen, a defect of
  ossification situated above the inner condyle of that bone which
  transmits a nerve. The same foramen and an additional ectepicondylar
  foramen are found in the ancient reptilian type <i>Hatteria</i>
  (<i>Sphenodon</i>); it occurs also in the Anomodont reptiles. It is as a
  rule only the lower forms among mammals which show this foramen; thus it
  is present in the Mole and absent in the <!-- Page 40 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page40"></a>{40}</span>Horse. The fact that it
  is occasionally met with in Man is an additional proof of the, in many
  respects, ancient structure of the highest type of Primate.</p>

  <p>The radius and the ulna, which together constitute the fore-arm, are
  both present in a large number of mammals, but the ulna tends to vanish
  in the purely walking and digitigrade Ungulates, being present, however,
  in the more ancient forms of these Ungulates. In Man and in many other
  mammals the radius can be moved from its normal position and crossed over
  the ulna; this movement of pronation has been permanently fixed in the
  Elephant, where the bones are crossed but cannot be altered in position
  by the contractions of any muscles. Other types agree with the Elephant
  in this fixation of the two bones.</p>

(From Flower's <i>Osteology</i>.)</p>

  <p>The bones of the wrist show great variation among mammals. The
  greatest number present are to be seen in such a type as the Mole. Here
  we have a proximal row, consisting of the scaphoid, lunar, cuneiform, and
  pisiform, which are arranged in their proper order, beginning with that
  on the radial side of the limb, that side which bears the first digit. A
  second row articulates proximally with these bonelets and distally with
  the metacarpals; the bones composing it are, mentioning them in the same
  order, trapezium, trapezoid, centrale, magnum, unciform.</p>

  <p>The centrale does not, however, really belong to the distal carpal
  row, and is as a rule situated in the middle of the carpus away from
  articulation with the metacarpals. It is a bone which is not commonly
  present in the mammalian hand, but is present in various lower forms,
  such as the Beaver and Hyrax. It also occurs in such high types as the
  majority of Monkeys; it is to be found in the Human foetal carpus. Many
  extinct forms possessed a separate centrale. Its importance in the
  formation of the interlocking condition of the Ungulate foot is referred
  to later, <!-- Page 41 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page41"></a>{41}</span>on p. <a href="#page196">196</a>. The only
  mammal which appears to have the proper five bones in the distal row of
  the carpus corresponding to the five metacarpals is <i>Hyperoodon</i>,
  where this state of affairs at least occasionally occurs. The final bone
  of that series, the unciform, seems to represent two bones fused. Very
  often the carpus is reduced by the fusion of certain of the carpal bones;
  thus among the Carnivora it is usual for the scaphoid and the lunar to be
  fused. It is interestingly significant that these bones retain their
  distinctness in the ancestral Creodonts. In many Ungulates the trapezium
  vanishes. The reduction of the toes in fact implies a reduction of the
  separate elements of the carpus.</p>

  <p>As to the digits of the mammalian hand, the greatest number is five,
  the various supplementary bonelets known as prepollex and postminimus
  being, it is now generally held, merely supplementary ossifications not
  representing the rudiments of pre-existing fingers. They may, however,
  bear claws.<a name="NtA_21" href="#Nt_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> The number
  of phalanges which follow upon the metacarpals is almost constantly three
  in the mammals, excepting for the thumb, which has only two. This is
  highly characteristic of the group as opposed to reptiles and birds, and
  the increase in the number of these bones in the Whales and to a very
  faint degree in the Sirenia is a special reduplication, which will be
  mentioned when those animals are treated of.</p>

  <p><b>The Pelvic Girdle.</b>&mdash;The pelvic girdle or hip girdle is the
  combined set of bones which are attached on the one hand to the sacrum
  and on the other articulate with the hind-limb. Four distinct elements
  are to be recognised in each "os innominatum," the name given to the
  conjoined bones of each half of the entire pelvis. These are<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span>the ilium, which articulates with the sacrum;
  the ischium, which is posterior; the pubis, which is anterior; and
  finally, a small element, the cotyloid, which lies within the acetabular
  cavity where the femur articulates. The epipubes of the Monotreme and the
  Marsupial are dealt with elsewhere (see p. <a href="#page116">116</a>) as
  they are peculiar to those groups.</p>

  <p>Professor Huxley pointed out many years since that while the Eutherian
  Mammalia differ from the reptiles in the fact that the axis of the ilium
  lies at a less angle with that of the sacrum, <!-- Page 42 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page42"></a>{42}</span><i>Ornithorhynchus</i>
  comes nearest to the reptile in the fact that this axis is nearly at
  right angles to that of the sacrum. It is particularly interesting to
  find that this peculiarity of <i>Ornithorhynchus</i> is only acquired
  later in life, and that the pelvis of the foetus conforms in these angles
  to the adults of other mammalian groups. In any case, the backward
  rotation of the pelvis is a mammalian characteristic, and it is most
  nearly approached among reptiles by the extinct Anomodontia, whose
  affinities to mammals will be dealt with on a later page (p. <a
  href="#page90">90</a>). Another peculiarity of the mammalian pelvis
  appears to be the cotyloid bone already referred to. In the Rabbit this
  bone completely shuts out the pubis from any share in the acetabular
  cavity; later it ankyloses with that bone. In <i>Ornithorhynchus</i> the
  cotyloid or os acetabuli is a larger element of the girdle than is the
  pubis. In other mammals, therefore, it seems to be a rudimentary
  structure. But it seems to be a bone peculiar to and thus distinctive of
  the mammals as compared with other vertebrates. The acetabular cavity is
  perforated in <i>Echidna</i> as in birds; but in certain Rodents the same
  region is very thin and only closed by membrane, as in <i>Circolabes
  villosus</i>.</p>

  <p>The number and the arrangement of the bones in the <b>hind-limb</b>
  correspond exactly to those of the fore-limb. The femur, which
  corresponds to the humerus, shows some diversities of form. The neck,
  which follows upon the almost globular head, the surface of articulation
  to the acetabular cavity of the pelvis, has two roughened areas or
  tuberosities for the insertions of muscles. A third such area, known as
  the third trochanter, is present or absent as the case may be, and its
  presence or absence is of systematic import. As a general rule the
  thigh-bones of the ancient types of mammals are smoother and less
  roughened by the presence of these three trochanters than in their modern
  representatives. The radius and the ulna are represented in the hind-leg
  by the tibia and the fibula. These bones are not crossed, and do not
  allow of rotation as is the case with the radius and the ulna. In
  Ungulate animals there is the same tendency to the shortening and
  rudimentary character of the fibula that occurs in the case of the ulna,
  but it is more marked. It has been shown in tracing the history of fossil
  Ungulates that the hind-limbs in their degree of degeneration are as a
  rule ahead of the fore-limbs. This is natural when we reflect that <!--
  Page 43 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page43"></a>{43}</span>the
  hind-limbs must have preceded the fore-limbs in their thorough adaptation
  to the cursorial mode of progression. In the Mammalia the ankle-joint is
  always what is termed cruro-tarsal, <i>i.e.</i> between the ends of the
  limb-bones and the proximal row of tarsals; not in the middle of the
  tarsus as in some Sauropsida (reptiles and birds). The bones of the ankle
  are much like those of the hand; but there are never more than two bones
  in the proximal row, which are the astragalus and the calcaneum. The
  former is perhaps to be looked upon as the equivalent of the cuneiform
  and lunar together. But the views as to the homologies of the tarsal
  bones differ widely. Below these is the navicular, regarded as a
  centrale. The distal row of the tarsus has four bones, three cuneiforms
  and a cuboid. Reduction is effected by the soldering together of two
  cuneiforms as in the Horse, by the fusion of the navicular and cuboid as
  in the Deer. No mammal has more than five toes, and the number tends to
  become reduced in cursorial animals (Rodents, Ungulates, Kangaroos).</p>

  <p><b>Teeth.</b>&mdash;The teeth of the Mammalia<a name="NtA_22"
  href="#Nt_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> differ from those of other vertebrated
  animals in a number of important points. These, however, entirely concern
  the form of the adult teeth, their position in the mouth, and the
  succession of the series of teeth. Developmentally and histologically
  there are no fundamental divergences from the teeth of vertebrates lower
  in the scale.</p>

  <p>In mammals, as for example in the Dog, the teeth consist of three
  kinds of tissue&mdash;the enamel, the dentine, and the cement. The enamel
  is derived from the epidermis of the mouth cavity, and the two remaining
  constituents from the underlying dermis. The teeth originate quite
  independently of the jaws, with which they are later so intimately
  connected; the independence of origin being one of the facts upon which
  the current theory <!-- Page 44 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page44"></a>{44}</span>of the nature of teeth is founded. It has
  been pointed out that the scales of the Elasmobranch fishes consist of a
  cap of enamel upon a base of dentine, the former being derived from the
  epidermis and modelled upon a papilla of the dermis whose cells secrete
  the dentine. The fact that similar structures arise within the mouth
  (<i>i.e.</i> the teeth) is explicable when it is remembered that the
  mouth itself is a late invagination from the outside of the body, and
  that therefore the retention by its tissues of the capacity to produce
  such structures is not remarkable.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:24%;">
      <a href="images/033.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/033.png"

coating would be continuous at the top of the
ridges. In all the figures the enamel is black,
the pulp white; the dentine represented by
horizontal lines, and the cement by dots.
(After Flower and Lydekker.)</p>

  <p>The relations of the three constituents of the tooth in its simplest
  form is shown in the accompanying diagram, where the intimate structure
  of the enamel, dentine, and cement (or crusta petrosa as it is sometimes
  called) is not indicated. The latter has the closest resemblance to bone.
  The dentine is traversed by fine canals which run parallel to each other
  and anastomose here and there. The enamel is formed of long prismatic
  fibres, and is excessively hard in structure, containing less animal
  matter than the other tooth tissues. To this fact is frequently <!-- Page
  45 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page45"></a>{45}</span>due the
  complicated patterns upon the grinding teeth of Ungulates, which are
  produced by the wearing away of the dentine and the cement, and the
  resistance of the enamel.</p>

  <p>The centre of the tooth papilla remains soft and forms the pulp of the
  tooth, which is continuous with the underlying tissues of the gum by a
  fine canal or a wide cavity as the case may be. In teeth which
  persistently grow throughout the lifetime of the animal, as for example
  the incisors of the Rodents, there is a wide intercommunication between
  the cavity of the tooth and the tissues of the gum; only a narrow canal
  exists in, for instance, the teeth of Man, and in fact in the vast
  majority of cases. The three constituents of the typical teeth are not,
  however, found in all mammals; the layer which is sometimes wanting is
  the enamel. This is the case with most Edentates; but the interesting
  discovery has been made (by Tomes) that in the Armadillo there is a
  downgrowth of the epidermis similar to that which forms the enamel in
  other mammals, a rudimentary "enamel organ."</p>

  <p>Teeth are present in nearly all the Mammalia; and where they are
  absent there is frequently some evidence to show that the loss is a
  recent one. The Whalebone Whales, the Monotremata, <i>Manis</i>, and the
  American Anteaters among the Edentata are devoid of teeth in the adult
  state. In several of these instances, however, more or less rudimentary
  teeth have been found, which either never cut the gums or else become
  lost early in life. The latter is the case with <i>Ornithorhynchus</i>,
  where there are teeth up to maturity (see p. <a href="#page113">113</a>).
  Kükenthal has found germs of teeth in Whales, and Röse in the Oriental
  <i>Manis</i>. The loss of the teeth in these cases seems to have some
  relation to the nature of the food. In ant-eating mammals, as in the
  Anteaters and <i>Echidna</i>, the ants are licked up by the long and
  viscid tongue, and require no mastication. Yet it must be remembered that
  <i>Orycteropus</i> is also an anteater, like the Marsupial
  <i>Myrmecobius</i>, both of which genera have teeth.</p>

  <p>The first of the essential peculiarities of the mammalian teeth as
  compared with those of other vertebrates concerns the position of the
  teeth in the mouth. There is no undoubted mammal extinct or living in
  which the teeth are attached to any bones other than the dentary, the
  maxilla, and the <!-- Page 46 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page46"></a>{46}</span>premaxilla. There are no vomerine, palatine,
  or pterygoid teeth, such as are met with in Amphibia and Reptilia.</p>

  <p>The other peculiarities of the mammalian teeth, though true of the
  great majority of cases, are none of them absolutely universal.</p>

  <p>But it is necessary to go into the subject at some length on account
  of the great importance which has been laid upon the teeth in deciding
  questions of relationship; moreover, largely no doubt on account of their
  hardness and imperishability, our knowledge of certain extinct forms of
  Mammalia is entirely based upon a few scattered teeth; while of some
  others, notably of the Triassic and Jurassic genera, there is not a great
  deal of evidence except that which is furnished by the teeth. Indeed the
  important place which odontography holds in comparative anatomy is from
  many points of view to be regretted, though inevitable. "In hardly any
  other system of organs of vertebrated animals," remarks Dr. Leche, "is
  there so much danger of confounding the results of convergence of
  development with true homologies, for scarcely any other set of organs is
  less conservative and more completely subservient to the lightest impulse
  from without." Affinities as indicated by the teeth are sometimes in
  direct contradiction to those afforded by other organs; or, as in the
  case of the simple Toothed Whales, no evidence of any kind is
  forthcoming. Dr. Leche has pointed out that, judged merely from its
  teeth, <i>Arctictis</i> would be referred to the Raccoons, though it is
  really a Viverrid; while <i>Bassariscus</i>, which Sir W. Flower showed
  to be a Raccoon, is in its teeth a Viverrid. Mr. Bateson has been obliged
  to hamper the subject with another difficulty.</p>

  <p>In dealing with the variations of teeth,<a name="NtA_23"
  href="#Nt_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> Mr. Bateson has brought together an
  immense number of facts, which tend to prove that the variability of
  these structures is much greater than had been previously recognised;
  that this variability is often symmetrical; and that in some animals, as
  in "<i>Canis cancrivorus</i>, a South American fox, the majority showed
  some abnormality." When we learn from Mr. Bateson that "of <i>Felis
  fontanieri</i>, an aberrant leopard, two skulls only are known, both
  showing dental abnormalities," it seems dangerous to rear too lofty a
  superstructure upon a single fossil jaw. It must be noted too that, <!--
  Page 47 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page47"></a>{47}</span>contrary
  to the prevailing superstition, it is not domestic animals which show the
  greatest amount of tooth variation. As to special homologies between
  tooth and tooth, with which we shall deal on a later page, Mr. Bateson
  has urged almost insuperable difficulties.</p>

<p class="capt"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 35.&mdash;Upper and lower teeth of one side of the mouth of a Dolphin (<i>Lagenorhynchus</i>),
illustrating the homodont type of dentition in a mammal. (After Flower
and Lydekker.)</p>

  <p>The teeth of the Mammalia are almost without exception "heterodont,"
  <i>i.e.</i> they show differences of structure in different parts of the
  mouth. As a general rule, teeth can be grouped into cutting incisors,
  sharp conical canines, and molars, with a surface which is in the
  majority of cases suited for grinding. In this they contrast with the
  majority of the lower vertebrates, where the teeth are "homodont" (or,
  better, <i>homoeodont</i>), <i>i.e.</i> all more or less similar and not
  fitted by change of form to perform different duties. But there are
  exceptions on both sides. In <!-- Page 48 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page48"></a>{48}</span>the Toothed Whales the teeth are homodont,
  as they are in the frog and in most reptiles; on the other hand, some of
  the remarkable reptiles belonging to Professor Huxley's order of the
  Anomodontia have distinct canines, and show other differentiations in
  their teeth.</p>

  <p>A second characteristic of the mammalian dentition is the limited
  number of the teeth, which rarely exceeds fifty-four. Here again the
  Toothed Whales are an exception, the number of their teeth being as great
  as in many reptiles. In the Mammalia the number of the teeth is fixed
  (excepting of course for abnormalities), while in reptiles there is
  frequently no precise normal. Two regions may be distinguished in every
  tooth&mdash;the crown and the root; the latter, as its name denotes, is
  imbedded in the gum, while the crown is the freely-projecting summit of
  the tooth. The varying proportions of these two regions of the tooth
  enables us to divide teeth into two series&mdash;the brachyodont and the
  hypselodont; in the latter the crown is developed at the expense of the
  root, which is small; the hypselodont tooth is one that grows from a
  persistent pulp or, at any rate, one that is long open. Brachyodont teeth
  on the contrary have narrow canals running into the dentine. The
  primitive form of the tooth seems undoubtedly to be a conical
  single-rooted tooth, such as is now preserved in the Toothed Whales and
  in the canine teeth of nearly all animals. The development of the teeth,
  that is, the simple bell-shaped form of the enamel organ, seems to go
  some way towards proving this; but it is quite another question whether
  we can fairly regard the Whales as having retained this early form of
  tooth. In their case the simplification, as is so often the case where
  organs are simplified, seems to be rather degeneration than retention of
  primitive characters. But this is a matter which must be deferred for the
  present.</p>

  <p>The incisor teeth are generally of simple structure and nearly always
  single rooted. In the Rodents, in the extinct Tillodontia and in
  Diprotodont Marsupials, they have grown large, and, as has been already
  stated, they increase in size continuously from the growing pulp. These
  teeth have a layer of enamel only on the anterior face, which keeps a
  sharp chisel-like edge upon them by reason of the fact that the harder
  enamel is worn away more slowly than the comparatively soft dentine. The
  <!-- Page 49 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page49"></a>{49}</span>"horn" of the Narwhal is another
  modification of an incisor, as are the tusks of Elephants. Among the
  Lemurs the incisors are denticulate, and serve to clean the fur in a
  comb-like fashion. This is markedly the case in <i>Galeopithecus</i>. The
  incisors are sometimes totally absent, as in the Sloths, sometimes
  partially absent, as in many Artiodactyles, where the lower incisors bite
  against a callous pad in the upper jaw, in which no trace of incisors has
  been found.</p>

  <p>Canine teeth are present in the majority of mammals, but are absent
  without a single exception from the jaws of the Rodentia. The canine
  tooth of the upper jaw is that tooth which comes immediately after the
  suture dividing the premaxillary from the maxillary bone. The canines are
  as a rule simple conical teeth, with but a single root; indeed they
  resemble what we may presume to have been the first kind of tooth
  developed in mammals. In this they resemble also as a general rule the
  foregoing incisors. But instances are known where the canines are
  implanted by two roots. This is to be seen in <i>Triconodon</i>, in the
  pig <i>Hyotherium</i>, in the Mole and some other Insectivores, and in
  <i>Galeopithecus</i>, where the incisors also may be thus implanted in
  the jaw. Furthermore, the simple condition of the crown of the tooth may
  be departed from. This is the case with a Fruit Bat belonging to the
  genus <i>Pteralopex</i>. In the more primitive Mammalia it is common to
  find no great difference between the canines and incisors; such is the
  case with the early Ungulate types of Eocene times, such as
  <i>Xiphodon</i>. In modern mammals, however, especially among the
  Carnivora, the canines tend to become larger and stronger than the
  incisors, and in some of the Cats and in the Walrus these teeth are
  represented by enormous offensive tusks. It is not rare for the canines
  of male animals to be larger than those of their mates. There are also
  cases such as the Musk-deer and the Kanchil where the male alone
  possesses these teeth, but only in the upper jaw. The teeth which follow
  the canines are known as the grinders or cheek teeth, or more technically
  as premolars and molars. These two latter terms separate teeth which
  arise at different periods, and their use will be explained later. In the
  meantime it may be pointed out that the cheek teeth are the teeth which
  show the greatest amount of variation in their structure; this is shown
  by the number and variety of the cusps in which <!-- Page 50 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page50"></a>{50}</span>the biting surface ends.
  The grinding teeth vary from simple one-cusped teeth, precisely like
  canines, to teeth with an enormous number of separate tubercles. In the
  former case it is hard to distinguish between incisors, canines, and
  cheek teeth in the lower jaw, where no suture separates the bone.
  Moreover it is quite common for the first cheek tooth in the lower jaw to
  have the characters of a canine, while the true canine approximates in
  its form to the antecedent incisors. This is so, for instance, with the
  Lemurs, where the first premolar is caniniform, and the canine shares in
  the curious procumbent attitude which distinguishes the lower incisors of
  many of those animals.</p>

  <p>A variable number of the anterior cheek teeth may be little more than
  simple conical teeth; but the rest of the set are commonly more
  complicated. No definite laws can be laid down as to the complication of
  the posterior as compared with the anterior set. Broadly speaking, it is
  purely herbivorous creatures in which the least difference can be
  detected at the two extremities, and which are at the same time the most
  elaborately decorated with tubercles and ridges. The converse is true
  that in purely carnivorous animals, including insect- and fish-eating
  forms, there is the greatest difference between the anterior set of
  grinding teeth and those which follow. In these two respects such animals
  as a Lemur and a Rhinoceros occupy the extremes. Furthermore, it may be
  said that omnivorous creatures lie, as their diet would suggest, in an
  intermediate position. Generally speaking, when there is a marked
  difference between the first premolar and molars at the end of the
  series, there is a gradual approximation in structure of a progressive
  kind. The tubercles become more numerous in successive teeth; but the
  corollary which is apparently deducible from this, <i>i.e.</i> that the
  last molar is the most elaborate of the series, is by no means always
  true. The last cheek tooth indeed is often degenerate. On the other hand,
  it is very markedly the largest of the series in such diverse types as
  the Elephant, the hog <i>Phacochoerus</i>, and the Rodent
  <i>Hydrochoerus</i>. It is a rule that the cheek teeth of the upper jaw
  are more complicated than the corresponding teeth of the lower jaw.</p>

  <p>The structure of the cheek teeth is very diverse among the Mammalia.
  Broadly, two types are to be recognised. There are <!-- Page 51 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page51"></a>{51}</span>teeth in which the
  grinding surface is raised into a series of two, to many, tubercles
  sharper or blunter as the case may be;&mdash;sharper and fewer at the
  same time in carnivorous and especially in insectivorous types, more
  abundant in omnivorous animals. To this form of tooth the term "bunodont"
  is applied. There is no doubt that this is the earliest type of tooth;
  but whether the fewer or the more cusped condition is the primitive one
  is a question that is reserved for consideration at the end of the
  present chapter. The other type of grinding tooth is known as
  "lophodont." This is exemplified by such types as the Perissodactyla and
  Ungulates generally, and by the Rodents. The tooth is traversed by ridges
  which have generally a transverse direction to the long axis of the jaw
  in which the tooth lies. The ridges may be regarded as having been
  developed between tubercles which they connect and whose distinctness as
  tubercles is thereby destroyed. Lophodont teeth are only found in
  vegetable-feeding animals.</p>

(After O. Hertwig.)</p>

  <p>A very general feature of the teeth of the Mammalia is what is usually
  termed the diphyodont dentition. In the majority of cases there are two
  sets of teeth developed, of which the first lasts for a comparatively
  short time, and is termed on account of its usual time of appearance the
  "milk dentition"; this is replaced later by the permanent dentition. In
  lower vertebrates the teeth are replaced as worn away. There is not,
  however, so great an antithesis in this matter between the Mammalia <!--
  Page 52 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page52"></a>{52}</span>and
  other vertebrates as was at one time assumed. But in order to explain
  this very important part of the subject it will be necessary to give some
  account of the development of the teeth. The type selected is the
  Hedgehog, which has been recently and carefully described by Dr. Leche of
  Stockholm, which type has furthermore the advantage of being a "central"
  type of mammal. The first step in the formation of the teeth is a
  continuous invagination of the epithelium covering the jaw to form a
  deepish wall of tissue running in the thickness of the jaw; this is
  perfectly continuous from end to end of the lower jaw. From this "common
  enamel germ" (<i>Schmelzleiste</i> of the Germans<a name="NtA_24"
  href="#Nt_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a>) "special enamel germs"
  (<i>Schmelzorgane</i>, enamel organs) are developed here and there as
  thickenings in the form of buds <!-- Page 53 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page53"></a>{53}</span>which arise on the outer side of the fold of
  epithelium and some way above its lower termination. These ultimately
  acquire a bell-like form, and are as it were moulded on to a thickened
  concentration of the dermis beneath; they then become separate from the
  downgrowth of the epithelium whence they have arisen. Finally, each of
  the eight germs becomes one of the milk teeth of the animal. The lower
  end of the sheet of invaginated epithelium, the common enamel germ, is
  the seat of the formation of the second set of teeth, of which, however,
  in the animal under consideration, there are only two in each jaw. But
  corresponding to each of the enamel germs of the milk dentition, with the
  exception of the first two molars, there is a slight thickening of the
  end of the common enamel germ, which at a certain stage is
  indistinguishable from the thickening which will become one of the
  permanent teeth. We have thus the diphyodont arrangement. But this does
  not exhaust the series of rudimentary teeth, though no more come to
  maturity than those whose development has already been touched upon. In
  the upper jaw a small outgrowth of the common enamel germ arises above
  and to the outer side of the enamel germ of the third milk incisor; this
  does not develop any further, but its resemblance to the commencing germ
  of a tooth seems to indicate that it is the remnant of a tooth series
  antecedent to the milk series. Furthermore, there are indications in the
  fourth premolar of a fourth series of teeth posterior in appearance to
  the permanent dentition. We arrive therefore at the important conclusion
  that although here as elsewhere there are only two sets of calcified
  teeth ever developed, there are feeble though unmistakable remains of two
  other series, one antecedent to and the other posterior to the diphyodont
  dentition. The gap therefore which separates the mammalian dentition from
  that of reptiles is less than has hitherto appeared. Dr. Leche also
  carefully studied the tooth development of <i>Iguana</i>; he found that
  in this lizard there are four series of teeth which come to maturity, and
  a rudimentary series antecedent to these which never produces fully
  formed teeth.</p>

  <p>In a few mammals there is a kind of dentition known as the
  monophyodont, in which only one series of teeth reaches maturity; where
  in fact there is no replacement of a milk series by a permanent
  dentition. Of the monophyodont dentition Whales form an example. The
  Marsupials are very nearly an instance of the <!-- Page 54 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page54"></a>{54}</span>same phenomenon; for Sir
  W. Flower showed, and Mr. Thomas confirmed his discovery, that only one
  tooth, according to Mr. Thomas the fourth premolar, is replaced in that
  group. But even the purely monophyodont dentition of the Toothed Whales
  is a more apparent than real contrast to the diphyodont dentition
  elsewhere prevalent. An investigation of the embryos of various Toothed
  Whales by Dr. Kükenthal and by Dr. Leche has brought to light the highly
  important fact that two dentitions are present, but that one only comes
  to maturity; from this fact obviously follows the interesting
  question<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span>To which of the two dentitions of
  more normal Mammalia does the monophyodont dentition of the Whales and
  Marsupials belong? To this question a clear answer is fortunately
  possible. As has been pointed out in the foregoing sketch of tooth
  development, and has been illustrated in the figures, the milk teeth
  develop as lateral outgrowths of the common enamel germ, while the
  permanent teeth arise from the end of the same band of tissue. This fact
  enables it to be stated apparently beyond a doubt that in the Whales and
  in the Marsupials it is the milk dentition which is the only one to
  arrive at maturity. Thus the earlier theoretical conclusion that the
  Marsupial dentition "is a secondary dentition with only one tooth of the
  primary set left," is proved on embryological grounds to be untrue. But
  there are other monophyodont animals than those already mentioned.<a
  name="NtA_25" href="#Nt_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> <i>Orycteropus</i>, the
  Cape Anteater, is an example. Mr. Thomas has lately discovered that in
  this Edentate there is a set of minute though calcified milk teeth which
  probably never cut the gum; here we have a different sort of
  monophyodontism, in which the teeth belong to the second and not to the
  first set. Between the latter condition and the diphyodont state are
  intermediate stages. Thus in the Sea Lions the milk teeth are developed
  but disappear early, probably before the animal is born.</p>

  <p>In the typical diphyodont dentition, such as is exhibited for example
  in Man and the vast majority of mammals, the milk teeth eventually
  completely disappear and are entirely replaced by the permanent set of
  teeth, with the exception, of course, of the molars, which though they
  are developed late belong to the milk series. <!-- Page 55 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page55"></a>{55}</span></p>

  <p>Their correspondence with the milk series is shown in an interesting
  way by the close resemblance which the last milk premolar often bears to
  the first molar. These two extremes of dentition, <i>i.e.</i> purely
  monophyodont and, excepting for the molars, purely diphyodont, are
  however connected by an intermediate state of affairs, which is
  represented by more than one stage. In <i>Borhyaena</i> (probably a
  Sparassodont) the incisors and the canines and two out of the four
  premolars belong to the permanent dentition, while the two remaining
  premolars and of course the three molars are of the milk series.
  <i>Prothylacinus</i>, a genus belonging to the same group, has a
  dentition which is a step or two further advanced in the direction of the
  recent Marsupials. We find, according to Ameghino,<a name="NtA_26"
  href="#Nt_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> whose conclusions are accepted by Mr.
  Lydekker, that the incisors, canines, and two premolars belong to the
  milk series, while the permanent series is represented only by the two
  remaining premolars. We can tabulate this series as follows<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>(1) Purely monophyodont, with teeth only of the first
  set&mdash;Toothed Whales.</p>

  <p>(2) Incompletely monophyodont, as in the Marsupials, where there is a
  milk dentition with only one tooth replaced.<a name="NtA_27"
  href="#Nt_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

  <p>(3) Incompletely diphyodont, with the dentition made up partly of
  milk, partly of permanent teeth, as in <i>Borhyaena</i>.</p>

  <p>(4) Diphyodont, where all the teeth except the molars are of the
  second set; this characterises nearly all the mammals.</p>

  <p>As we pass from older forms to their more recent representatives there
  is as a rule a progressive development of the form of the teeth. This is
  especially marked among the Ungulata. The extremely complicated type of
  tooth found in such a form as the existing Horse can be traced back
  through a series of stages to a tooth in which the crown is marked by a
  few separated tubercles or cusps. Arrived at this point, the differences
  between the teeth of ancestral Horses and ancestral Rhinoceroses and
  Tapirs are hard to distinguish with accuracy; and the same difficulty is
  experienced in attempting to give a definition of other large orders by
  the characters of the teeth, such as will apply to the Eocene or <!--
  Page 56 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page56"></a>{56}</span>even
  earlier representatives of these families. Fig. 36 (p. <a
  href="#page51">51</a>) illustrating a series of mammalian teeth will
  illustrate the above remarks. That there is such a convergence in tooth
  structure shows that it is, theoretically at least, possible to determine
  the ancestral form of the mammalian tooth. Practically, however, the
  difficulties which beset such theorising are great; that there are such
  divergent and such strongly-held antithetical views is sufficient proof
  of this. Two main views hold the field: one, which has found most favour
  in America, and is due chiefly to the labours and persuasiveness of
  Professors Cope, Scott, Osborn, and others, is known as "trituberculy."<a
  name="NtA_28" href="#Nt_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> The alternative view, as
  urged by Forsyth Major, Woodward, and Goodrich, attempts to show that the
  dentition of the original mammal included grinding teeth which were
  multicuspidate or "multitubercular." There is much to be said for both
  views, and something to be said against both.</p>

(After Osborn and Wortman.)</p>

  <p>This question is, however, wrapped up in a wider one. Its solution
  depends upon the ancestry of mammals. If the Mammalia are to be derived
  from reptiles with simple conical teeth, then the first stage in the
  development of trituberculy is proved. On the other hand, however, the
  evidence is gradually growing that the Theromorpha represent more nearly
  than any non-mammalian group with which we are acquainted the probable
  ancestral form of the mammals. These animals offer some support to both
  the leading views. <i>Cynognathus</i> had triconodont teeth which, as
  will be pointed out later, are a theoretically intermediate stage in the
  evolution of tritubercular teeth; on the other hand, the teeth of
  <i>Diademodon</i> and some others are multituberculate, and have been
  very properly compared to the multitubercular teeth of such primitive
  mammalia as the Ornithorhynchus. Professor Osborn is no doubt correct in
  italicising a remark of an anonymous writer in <i>Science</i> to the
  effect that in <i>Diademodon</i> the teeth, though multitubercular, show
  the prevalence of three cusps arranged in the tritubercular fashion. <!--
  Page 57 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page57"></a>{57}</span>But this
  may be only a proof that the multitubercular antedates the tritubercular.
  It may be, indeed, that the mammalian tooth was already differentiated
  among the mammal-like Saurians and that from such a form as
  <i>Cynognathus</i> the Eutheria and other forms in which a tritubercular
  arrangement can be detected were evolved, and from such form as
  <i>Tritylodon</i> the Monotrematous branch of the mammals. This way of
  looking at the matter harmonises a much-disputed question, but involves a
  diphyletic origin of the mammals&mdash;an origin which for other reasons
  is not without its supporters.</p>

  <p>We shall now attempt to give a general idea of the facts and arguments
  which support or tend to support "trituberculy." As a matter of fact the
  name is inaccurate; for the holders of this view do not derive the
  mammalian molar from a trituberculate condition, but in the first place
  from a simple cone such as that of a crocodile!</p>

  <p>To this main and at first only cusp came as a reinforcement an
  additional cusp at each side, or rather at each end, having regard to
  their position with reference to the long axis of the jaw. This stage is
  the "triconodont" stage, and teeth exist among living as well as extinct
  mammals which show this early form of tooth. We have, indeed, the genus
  <i>Triconodon</i>, so named on that very account. Among living mammals
  the Seals and the Thylacine all show some triconodont teeth. A Toothed
  Whale, it may be remarked, is a living example of a mammal with
  monoconodont teeth. The three primary cusps, as the supporters of Cope's
  theory of trituberculism denominate them, are termed respectively the
  protocone, paracone, and metacone, or, if they are in the teeth of the
  lower jaw, protoconid, paraconid, and metaconid. At a slightly later
  stage, or coincidently, a rim partly surrounded the crown of the tooth;
  the rim is known as the cingulum, and from a prominent elevation of this
  rim a fourth cusp, the hypocone, was developed. The three main cones then
  moved, or rather two of them moved, so as to form a triangle; this is the
  tritubercular stage. Teeth of this pattern are common, and occur in such
  ancient forms as Insectivora and Lemurs, besides numerous extinct groups.
  An amendment has been suggested, and that is to term the teeth with the
  simple primitive triangle "trigonodont," and to reserve the term
  tritubercular for those teeth in which the hypocone has appeared. The
  platform bearing the hypocone widened into the <!-- Page 58 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page58"></a>{58}</span>"talon"; and this ledge
  became produced into two additional cusps, the hypoconule or hypoconulid,
  and the ectocone or ectoconid. Thus the typical sextuberculate tooth of
  the primitive Ungulate, and indeed of many primitive Eutherians, is
  arrived at. From this the still further complicated teeth of modern
  Ungulates can be derived by further additions or fusions, etc.<a

  <p>That such a series can be traced is an undoubted fact. Every stage
  exists, or has existed. But whether the stages can be connected or not is
  quite another question. It is by three main lines of argument that the
  view here sketched out in brief is supported. In the first place, the
  tracing of the pedigrees of many groups of mammals has met with very
  considerable success; and it is clear that as we pass from the living
  Horse and Rhinoceros, with their complicated molars, to their
  forerunners, we find that both can be referred to a primitive Ungulate
  molar with but six cusps. Going still further back to the lowest Eocene
  and ancestral type as it appears, <i>Euprotogonia</i>, we still find in
  the molar tooth the sextubercular plan of structure. We can hardly get
  further back in the evolution of the Perissodactyles with any probability
  of security. On the other hand, many facts point to a fundamental
  relationship between the primitive Ungulates and the early Creodonts. The
  latter frequently show plainly tritubercular molars. Such Ungulates as
  <i>Euprotogonia</i> and <i>Protogonodon</i>, though sex- or
  quinque-tubercular as to their molars, have a distinctly prevailing
  trituberculism, when the <i>size</i> and importance of three of the cusps
  is taken into account. But this <!-- Page 59 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page59"></a>{59}</span>lacks finality as a convincing proof of the
  tritubercular tooth as a primitive Ungulate tooth.</p>

  <p>Professor Osborn has ingeniously utilised certain deviations from the
  normal type of tooth structure (for the group) in favour of his
  strongly-urged opinions. If the stages of development have been as he
  suggests, a retrogression would naturally be in the inverse order; thus
  the "apparently 'triconodont' lower molar of <i>Thylacinus</i>" may be
  interpreted as a retrogression from a tritubercular tooth. In the same
  way may be explained the triconodont teeth of Seals and of the Cetacean
  <i>Zeuglodon</i>. Finally, the modern Toothed Whales have retrograded
  into "haplodonty."</p>

  <p>Embryological evidence has also been called in, and with some success,
  to contribute towards the proof of the tritubercular theory of teeth.
  Taeker has shown that in the Horse and the Pig, and some other Ungulates,
  there is first of all a single hillock or cusp, and that later the
  additional cones arise separately. An apparent stumbling-block raised by
  these investigations is that it is not always the protocone or its
  equivalent in the upper jaw which arises first, as it obviously ought to
  do phylogenetically. This, however, is not a final argument in either
  direction. We know from plenty of examples that ontogenetic processes
  sometimes do not correspond in their order with phylogenetic changes.
  Thus in the mammalian heart the ventricle divides before the auricle; and
  of coarse, phylogenetically, the reverse ought to occur, since a divided
  auricle precedes a divided ventricle. This method of development has,
  moreover, been interpreted otherwise. It has been held to signify that
  the complex teeth of mammals are indeed derived from simple cones but by
  the fusion of a number of those cones.</p>

  <p>On the other hand there are the claims of the multitubercular theory
  of the origin of mammalian teeth to be considered. The palaeontological
  evidence has been already, to some extent, utilised. The occurrence of
  such teeth among the possible forerunners of mammals, and in some of the
  most primitive types of Mammalia, has been referred to. Señor Ameghino
  dwells upon the sextubercular condition of many primitive mammals even
  belonging to the Eutheria. In a recent communication<a name="NtA_30"
  href="#Nt_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a> he attempts to identify six tubercles
  in the molars of types belonging to a <!-- Page 60 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page60"></a>{60}</span>variety of Orders. The
  same condition, as has been noted, characterises that ancient Ungulate
  form <i>Euprotogonia</i>. Even where the teeth seem at first sight to be
  tritubercular a detailed study shows traces of otherwise vanished
  cusps.</p>

  <p>It must be remembered in basing arguments upon the early Jurassic and
  Cretaceous mammals, that our knowledge of them mainly depends upon lower
  jaws, the teeth of which are usually simpler in pattern than those of the
  upper jaws. Moreover, another fact, not always insisted upon, must not be
  lost sight of. In many of those creatures the jaws were of small size,
  and yet accommodated a large series of molar teeth. <i>Amphitherium</i>,
  for example, had six molar teeth, and five is a number frequently met
  with. As the teeth are so numerous and the jaws so small it seems
  reasonable to connect the simplicity of the structure of the teeth with
  the need for crowding a number together. The same argument may partly
  account for the superabundant teeth of many Toothed Whales. It is true
  that the Manatee has very numerous grinders which are yet complex; but
  then in this animal there is a succession, and the jaw does not hold at a
  given time the entire series, with which it is provided in relays. On the
  other hand, where there are few molars they are often of the
  multitubercular type, or at least approach it; of this the
  Multituberculate <i>Polymastodon</i> is a good example; so, too, the
  molars of <i>Hydrochoerus</i>, and of many other Rodents.</p>

  <p>It is well known that the fourth deciduous molar of the upper jaw,
  which is replaced by a permanent premolar in the fully adult animal, is
  of a more complex structure than its successor. This may indeed be
  extended to premolars earlier in the series. In the Dog "the second and
  first milk molars closely resemble the third and second premolars"; now
  the milk premolars belong evidently to the same dentition as the
  permanent molars, and they are earlier teeth than the later-developed
  replacing teeth. It is therefore significant that these earlier teeth
  should be more cuspidate than the later teeth. It tells distinctly in
  favour of the simplification as opposed to the complication of teeth in
  time, in the groups concerned.</p>

  <p>These facts may possibly be applied in explanation of the simple teeth
  of some of the Jurassic and Cretaceous mammals. It has been mentioned
  that absolute trituberculy is exceedingly rare among those ancient
  creatures; more generally there are to <!-- Page 61 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page61"></a>{61}</span>be found at least traces
  of more cusps. Now in some of them we may be dealing with instances of a
  complete tooth change; the suppression, save for one tooth, which is
  found in Marsupials, was probably not developed in at least some of these
  early mammals. The simplicity may therefore have been preceded by
  complexity, and may have been merely an adaptation to an insectivorous
  diet.</p>

  <p><b>Alimentary Canal.</b>&mdash;The <i>mouth</i> of the Mammalia is
  remarkable for the fact that with a few exceptions, such as the Whales,
  there are thick and fleshy lips. The office of these is to seize the
  food. The roof of the mouth is formed by the "hard palate" in front,
  which covers over the maxillary and palatine regions. This region is
  often covered with raised ridges, which have a symmetrical disposition,
  and are particularly strong in Ruminant animals. They are much reduced in
  the Rodents, where the anterior part of the palate is ill-defined owing
  to the way in which its sides fade into the lateral surface of the face.
  It has been shown that these ridges, in the Cat at least, develop as
  separate papilliform outgrowths, and it has been suggested that these
  papillae, which later become united to form the ridges, are the last
  remnant of palatine teeth such as occur in lower vertebrates.</p>

Wiedersheim's <i>Structure of Man</i>.)</p>

  <p>The <i>tongue</i> is a well-developed organ, usually playing a double
  part. It acts as an organ of prehension, especially in such animals as
  the Giraffe and the Anteater, where it is long and protrusible beyond the
  mouth for a considerable distance. It also carries gustatory organs,
  which serve for the discrimination of the nature of the food. Beneath the
  tongue there may be a hardish plate, known as the sublingua. This is
  especially prominent in the Lemurs, where it projects as a horny
  structure below the tongue, and has an independent and free tip. It is
  supported in some of these animals by a cartilaginous <!-- Page 62
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page62"></a>{62}</span>structure. It is
  held by Gegenbaur that this organ is the equivalent of the reptilian
  tongue, and that in the skeletal vestiges which it contains are to be
  found the equivalents of the hyoid skeletal cartilages which support the
  tongue in lizards. In this case the tongue of mammals is a subsequently
  added structure.</p>

  <p>The <i>oesophagus</i> leads from the mouth cavity to the
  <i>stomach</i>. The latter organ has commonly a distinctive shape in
  mammals. This is well shown in Man. The orifices of the oesophagus and
  intestine are somewhat approximated; and this causes a bulging of the
  lower border of the organ, usually spoken of as the greater curvature. A
  stomach of this typical form is found in many orders of mammals, and is
  unlike the stomach in any of the groups of lower vertebrates in shape.
  Sometimes the shape of the organ is greatly altered: it may be drawn out,
  sacculated, or divided, as in the Ruminants and Whales, into a series of
  differentiated chambers, each of which plays some special part in the
  phenomena of digestion.</p>

  <p>The <i>intestine</i> of mammals is always long and much coiled, though
  the length and consequent degree of coiling naturally varies. On the
  whole it is perhaps safe to say that it is shorter in carnivorous than in
  vegetable-feeding beasts. Thus the Paca has an intestine of 39 inches
  total length, while the Cat, an animal of about the same size, has an
  intestine which is only 36 inches long. A fish diet, however, to judge
  from the Seals, is associated with a long intestinal tract. The intestine
  is divisible in the vast majority of mammals into a small and a large
  intestine. The two are separated by a valvular constriction save in
  certain Carnivores; and in the majority of cases the distinction is also
  emphasised by the presence at the junction of a blindly-ending
  diverticulum, the <i>caecum</i>. This latter organ varies greatly in
  length, being very short in the Cat-tribe and exceedingly long in
  Rodents. Its size is, to some extent, dependent upon the flesh-eating or
  grass-eating propensities of the animal in which it occurs. One of the
  longest caeca is possessed by the Vulpine Phalanger, in which the organ
  is one-fifth of the length of the small intestine; while the opposite
  extremity is reached by <i>Felis macroscelis</i>, which has a small
  intestine one hundred times the length of the caecum.</p>

  <p>An interesting point in connexion with the gut of mammals is the
  varying proportion of the small to the large intestine. As a general rule
  the former is very considerably longer than the latter; in
  <i>Paradoxurus</i>, for instance, the small intestine may be fifteen
  times the length of the large. The excess of length of one section over
  the other is not generally so marked <!-- Page 64 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page64"></a>{64}</span>as this. In <i>Phalanger
  maculatus</i> the two sections of the gut are as nearly as possible equal
  in length, while in <i>Phaseolarctos</i> the large intestine is
  considerably longer than the small, the lengths being respectively 160
  inches and 111 inches. It is common among the Marsupials and also among
  the Rodents for these proportions to exist, <i>i.e.</i> for the large
  intestine to be as long as, or longer than, the small. But there are so
  many exceptions that no general statements can be extracted from the
  facts.</p>

  <p>Some few details will be found in the systematic part of this book.
  Mr. Chalmers Mitchell has brought forward some reasons for associating a
  great length of large intestine with an archaic systematic position, in
  the birds at any rate. The facts here briefly touched upon are not at
  variance with the extension of such a view to the mammals.</p>

  <p>Appended to the alimentary tract are three glands or sets of glands.
  Opening into the mouth cavity are the <i>salivary glands</i>, which are
  of enormous size in Anteaters, and small or absent in Whales. In their
  number and position these glands are characteristic of mammals. Into the
  intestine open the ducts of the pancreas and liver, two glands which the
  mammals share with lower vertebrates. The form of the <i>liver</i> is,
  however, generally characteristic of mammals. It is divided as a rule
  into a right and a left half, the line of division being marked by the
  insertion of the umbilical ligament, a vestige of the primitive ventral
  mesentery. Each half is again commonly subdivided into central and
  lateral lobes. In addition to these, two other divisions are often to be
  seen&mdash;the Spigelian and the caudate lobe. The liver is less divided
  in Cetacea and <!-- Page 65 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page65"></a>{65}</span>some others, very much subdivided in Rodents
  and other groups. The degree of subdivision and the proportions of the
  several lobes frequently offer valuable systematic characters. The
  gall-bladder may be present or absent; it is always a diverticulum of the
  hepatic duct. The two are never separate, as in birds, for instance.</p>

  <p><b>Organs of Circulation.</b>&mdash;The heart of all mammals is a
  completely four-chambered organ. In the adult heart there is no
  communication between the right and left halves. The auricles are
  comparatively thin-walled, the ventricles thick-walled, in relation to
  the amount of work that they have severally to perform. The right
  ventricle, moreover, which has only to drive the blood into the lungs, is
  much thinner-walled than the left ventricle, which is concerned with the
  entire systemic circulation. The exits of the arteries and the
  auriculo-ventricular orifices are guarded by valves, which are so
  arranged as only to permit the blood to flow in the proper direction. But
  these valves have a morphological as well as a physiological interest. At
  the origin of each artery, the aorta and the pulmonary, there is a row of
  three watch-pocket valves, as they have been generally termed on account
  of their form. These three valves meet accurately in the middle of the
  lumen of the arterial tube when liquid is poured into them from above,
  and thus completely occlude the orifice. The auriculo-ventricular valves
  differ in structure in the two ventricles. That of the left ventricle has
  only two flaps, and is therefore often spoken of as the bicuspid or
  mitral valve. Both these flaps are membranous, and together they
  completely surround the exit from the auricle into the ventricle. The
  edges of the valve are bound down to the parietes of the heart by
  numerous branching tendinous threads, the chordae tendineae, which often
  take their origin from pillar-like muscles arising from the walls of the
  heart, the so-called musculi papillares. The valve of the right ventricle
  is composed of three flaps, and is therefore often spoken of as the
  tricuspid valve; it is in the same way membranous, and has chordae
  tendineae and musculi papillares connected with it. The disposition of
  the musculi papillares and their number differ in different mammals, but
  no exhaustive study has as yet been made of the arrangements in different
  groups; the amount of individual variation even is not known, though it
  is certainly considerable in some cases, for <!-- Page 66 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page66"></a>{66}</span>instance in the heart of
  the Rabbit. The heart of the Monotremata presents differences of some
  importance from those of other Mammalia; the modern knowledge of the
  Monotrematous heart is mainly due to Gegenbaur<a name="NtA_31"
  href="#Nt_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> and Lankester,<a name="NtA_32"
  href="#Nt_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a> in whose memoirs references to the
  older literature will be found. The principal features of interest in
  which the heart of the Monotremata differs from that of the higher
  Mammalia are these. When the two ventricles are cut across transversely,
  the cavity of the right is seen to be wrapped round that of the left in a
  fashion precisely like that of the bird's heart; on the other hand in the
  higher mammal the two cavities lie side by side. The main difference
  between Monotremes and other Mammals concerns the right
  auriculo-ventricular valve. The differences which it presents from the
  corresponding structure of the rest of the Mammalia are two: in the first
  place, the valve itself does not completely surround the ostium; it is
  only developed on one side; the septal half (<i>i.e.</i> that turned
  towards the interventricular septum) is either entirely absent or more
  generally represented by a small bit of membrane; nevertheless I found<a
  name="NtA_33" href="#Nt_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a> recently in an
  <i>Ornithorhynchus</i> heart a complete septal half to the right
  auriculo-ventricular valve. The second point of interest in connexion
  with this valve is, that the musculi papillares instead of ending in
  chordae tendineae attached to the free edge of the valve are directly
  attached to the valve, and in some cases pass through its membranous
  flap, to be attached to its origin at the boundary of the auricle and of
  the ventricle. The invading of the valve-flap by muscle in this way is
  highly interesting, as it recalls the heart of the bird and of the
  crocodile. The imperfect condition of the valve (from which, as has
  already been stated, the septal half is as a rule nearly absent) is a
  point of resemblance to the heart of the bird; the corresponding valve of
  the crocodile's heart being complete.</p>

  <p>There are also features in the system of arteries and veins which are
  eminently distinctive of mammals. In the first place, the aorta leaving
  the heart and conveying blood to the body is only a half arch, and bends
  to the left side as seen in Fig. 43. The right and left halves are
  present in reptiles, and meet behind the heart. In the bird the right
  half alone has remained. This fact, therefore, shows that the mammal
  cannot have been derived from a bird-like ancestor, but that both must
  have independently come from an ancestor with both halves of the aortic
  arch present, of which one half has disappeared in one group, and the
  other half in the other. It is an interesting fact, too, to notice that
  the four <!-- Page 68 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page68"></a>{68}</span>cavities of the mammal's heart, which
  fourfold division it shares with birds alone, do not exactly correspond
  compartment for compartment with those of the bird's heart, at least in
  so far as concerns the ventricles. For the reptilian heart is provided
  with only one ventricle, and therefore the division of that cavity must
  have been independently accomplished in mammals and in birds.</p>

  <p>There are two features in the venous system which distinguish all the
  Mammalia (with the exception of <i>Echidna</i> in one of these points)
  from vertebrates standing lower in the series. The hepatic portal system
  is limited to a vein which conveys to the liver blood derived from the
  alimentary tract; in no mammal except in <i>Echidna</i> is there any
  representative of the anterior abdominal vein of lower vertebrates. In
  that animal there is such a vein, which apparently arises from a
  capillary network upon the bladder and passes up, supported by a
  membrane, along the ventral wall of the abdomen to the liver, thus
  emptying blood into that organ exactly as does the anterior abdominal
  vein of the frog. In no mammal is there any trace of a renal portal
  system. The kidneys derive their blood from the renal arteries only.</p>

  <p>Many mammals have two superior venae cavae; this is the case, for
  instance, in the Elephant and the Rodents and other types lying
  comparatively far down in the series. In most if not in all mammals there
  are considerable remains of one of the posterior cardinals, in the form
  of the azygos vein, which opens into the vena cava superior or pre-caval
  vein, <i>i.e.</i> the superior cardinal just before the latter debouches
  into the heart. This one posterior cardinal is usually on the right side;
  but it may be on the left side, for instance in <i>Trichosurus
  vulpecula</i>. In <i>Halmaturus bennettii</i> there are two azygos veins,
  one left and one right, of which the left is rather the larger.<a

  <p><b>Urinary Organs.</b>&mdash;The kidneys in the Mammalia have a
  compact form, which contrasts with the somewhat diffuse and
  vaguely-outlined kidneys of the Sauropsida. In mammals the organ is as a
  rule of that peculiar shape which is called "kidney-shaped"; a depression
  termed the hilum, which receives the ducts of the glands, indenting the
  border of an otherwise oval-shaped gland. In some few mammals the kidney
  is broken up <!-- Page 69 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page69"></a>{69}</span>into lobules; this is the case with the
  Whales, the Bears, the Oxen, and a few other forms. A curious fact about
  the kidneys of the Mammalia is their very general asymmetry of position.
  One of them usually lies in a more advanced position than the other. The
  ureters lead from the kidneys to the urinary bladder, which in its form
  and relations is quite distinctive of the Mammalia. The bladder is formed
  out of the remains of the allantois, and is therefore not the exact
  homologue of the bladder of the frog, which is the equivalent of the
  entire sac which grows out of the cloaca in the mammal, and is the foetal
  allantois. The ureters open into the bladder in the higher Mammalia, but
  lower down in the urino-genital passage in the more primitive
  mammals.</p>

  <p><b>The Body Cavity.</b>&mdash;The Mammalia differ from all other
  living vertebrates by the arrangement of the body cavity in which lie the
  viscera. That cavity is divided into two by a partly muscular and partly
  tendinous partition, the diaphragm. No other vertebrate has this precise
  disposition of the coelom. The diaphragm lies usually transversely to the
  longitudinal axis of the body, but gets a much more oblique arrangement
  in the Cetacea and the Sirenia, whose needs demand a more expanded
  chamber for the lungs. For in front of the diaphragm lie the lungs and
  heart; behind it the stomach, liver, intestines, and the organs of
  reproduction and excretion. The diaphragm is used in respiration; when
  its muscles contract, the surface directed toward the pleural cavity
  becomes less convex, and the cavity of the lungs is thus increased,
  allowing them to expand under the pressure of the entering air.</p>

  <p><b>The Lungs.</b>&mdash;The lungs of the Mammalia differ from those of
  animals lying lower in the series by the fact, just referred to, that
  they occupy a pleural cavity completely shut off from the abdomen by the
  diaphragm. As a rule the lungs of the Mammalia are to be distinguished by
  their more or less extensive lobation. In the Whales, however, and in the
  Sirenia, they are not much divided, but present the appearance of the
  simple sac-like lungs of the reptiles. In some mammals there is a median
  and posterior unpaired lobe of the lung, which lies in the
  post-pericardial cavity behind the pericardium. This is not universally
  present. The lungs are very frequently not symmetrical in their lobation,
  the number of separate lobes on the right side <!-- Page 70 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page70"></a>{70}</span>and on the left being
  different. The lungs of mammals agree with those of the lower reptiles in
  being freely suspended within their coelomic cavity, and in not being, as
  in birds, crocodiles, and the Varanidae among lizards, tied down to the
  dorsal surface of that cavity by a sheet of peritoneum covering them.</p>

  <p><b>The Gonads (Ovaries and Testes).</b>&mdash;The ovary in the
  Mammalia is always paired; there is never a partial or complete abortion
  of one gonad as in birds&mdash;except of course in pathological cases.
  The ovaries are small, and lie in the abdominal cavity behind the
  kidneys. In the immense majority of the Mammalia the ova which are
  produced within the ovaries are of minute size; those of even the
  colossal Rorqual are, so far as we know, not markedly larger than the ova
  of a Mouse. The smallness of size of these reproductive elements implies
  necessarily an absence of much nutritive yolk; and as a consequence the
  developing embryo, since it is not hatched in an early stage as a free
  living larva, has to be nourished by the mother, to whose tissues it is
  attached through the intermediary of the placenta, a structure partly
  composed of foetal structures derived from the embryo, and partly of
  portions of the lining membranes of the uterus of the mother. The ova of
  the <!-- Page 71 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page71"></a>{71}</span>Eutherian mammals, including the Marsupials,
  are very small as compared with those of any other vertebrates, excepting
  only <i>Amphioxus</i>, where the young are hatched early as free swimming
  larvae. They also differ in a highly characteristic way in the mode of
  their development within the ovary. These processes are to some extent
  illustrated in Fig. 44. The main framework of the ovary is formed of the
  so-called "stroma," which is a mass of tissue formed of more or less
  connective-tissue-like cells. Within this are numerous cavities, the
  Graafian follicles. The very young follicles consist of but a single
  layer of follicular cells surrounding the ovum, which lies centrally. The
  follicular cells gradually increase in number until the ovum lies in the
  midst of several layers of cells. At this period a vacuity is formed
  between some of these cells, and grows into a large cell-free cavity; the
  ovum does not lie loosely in this space, but is connected at one side
  with the follicular cells, which still line the interior of the Graafian
  follicle by the so-called discus or cumulus proligerus. The egg or ovum
  has, moreover, a layer of cells immediately surrounding itself. All these
  facts can be gathered by an inspection of Fig. 45. It has been shown
  that, as in lower vertebrates, the cells immediately surrounding the ovum
  are connected with it directly by delicate processes which penetrate the
  actual membrane of the egg.</p>

  with Owen and with Professor Poulton, who pointed out in 1884,<a

  <i>Ornithorhynchus</i> is very large as compared with those of other
  Mammalia (6 mm. as against .2 mm.), that it is filled with yolk, and that
  it completely fills the follicle, being surrounded by two layers of
  follicular cells only. This latter fact was proved by Caldwell.
  Subsequently Gyldberg<a name="NtA_36" href="#Nt_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a>
  and I<a name="NtA_37" href="#Nt_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a> described the

  <i>Ornithorhynchus</i>. Later still a more elaborate and beautifully
  illustrated paper was published by Caldwell<a name="NtA_38"
  href="#Nt_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> upon the early stages of development in
  the Monotremata and Marsupials, in which the ovum of the former was
  accurately described (see Fig. 46). In the particulars mentioned above,
  the ovum of the Monotremata is practically identical with that of the
  large-yolked ova of the Sauropsida. <!-- Page 73 --><span

  <p>It is the general rule among vertebrate animals that the ovaries are
  completely independent of the ducts which convey their products to the
  exterior. In certain fishes, however, there is an absolute continuity
  between the two structures, which is believed to be due to a simple
  concrescence between the originally distinct ovary and oviduct. The
  latter has grown round the former, an obvious advantage in preventing the
  eggs from wandering into the abdominal cavity and becoming lost. In the
  Mammalia we find discontinuity as a general rule. But in quite a number
  of forms folds of the lining membrane of the abdominal cavity are
  developed, which practically ensure the passage of the ova into the
  oviduct when they are extruded from the ovaries. The oviduct, moreover,
  has a large and fimbriated mouth, called in human anatomy&mdash;which is
  provided with a number of fanciful names&mdash;the morsus diaboli. This
  almost wraps round the ovary, and thus prevents the ova from straying in
  the wrong direction. Moreover, the ovary itself is often so arranged that
  it can easily be withdrawn into a pocket of the peritoneum, from which
  the obvious exit is by the gaping mouth of the oviduct. This disposition
  of the generative parts is still further modified in a few animals, such
  as the Rat<a name="NtA_39" href="#Nt_39"><sup>[39]</sup></a> and the
  Kinkajou.<a name="NtA_40" href="#Nt_40"><sup>[40]</sup></a> In these
  animals the mouth of the oviduct actually opens into the interior of a
  closed chamber which contains the ovary. In this case there is but one
  route for the <!-- Page 74 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page74"></a>{74}</span>extruded ova to follow. This series of steps
  in the perfecting of the mode of safe extrusion of the ova is highly
  interesting, and is a piece of evidence in favour of the high position of
  the mammals.</p>

  <p>The oviducal apparatus of the mammal is more specialised than that of
  lower vertebrates. It is most simple, as might be imagined, in the
  egg-laying Monotremes, where, indeed, it is on the same level as that of
  reptiles. But in the Eutheria the fimbriated mouth of the oviduct passes
  into a narrow and winding tube, the Fallopian tube; this widens into a
  uterus, and the two uteri combine into a single tube in the higher forms.
  They are called the Monodelphia on this account. In the Marsupials the
  uteri are distinct though they often join above, and from this junction
  depends a median "uterus." After the uterus or the uteri follows in every
  case a single vagina.</p>

  <p>The testes of the Mammalia, like those of other vertebrates, occupy
  primitively a position within the body cavity precisely corresponding to
  that of the ovaries. And in the lowly-organised Monotremata, and some
  other forms, such as the Whales, they retain that primitive position
  within the body. It is, however, distinctive of the Mammalia as opposed
  to lower vertebrates that the testes descend later into a scrotum, which
  is simply a protrusion of the skin of the body surrounded by muscles,
  and, of course, containing a section of the body cavity in which lie the
  testes. The penis of the Mammalia, represented by the clitoris and
  associated structures in the female, is of a structure entirely peculiar
  to this group.</p>

  <p><b>The Brain.</b>&mdash;Inasmuch as Professor Wiedersheim has said
  with perfect truth that "the brain of the extinct Ungulate
  <i>Dinoceras</i> shows so striking a likeness to that of a lizard that
  one would be compelled to explain it as that of a lizard without a
  knowledge of the skeleton," it is clear that to define the mammalian
  brain is a difficult matter. The existing Mammalia, however, all possess
  brains which can be readily distinguished from those of vertebrates lying
  lower in the scale. They are of relatively large size, brought about
  mainly by the dimensions of the cerebral hemispheres, which have an
  importance in this class of vertebrates that they have not elsewhere.
  Coupled with this large size of the hemispheres is a more elaborate
  system of transverse commissures uniting the two; and this culminates in
  the higher Mammalia, where the corpus callosum attains a large size and
  great physiological importance. A <!-- Page 76 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page76"></a>{76}</span>very marked feature,
  moreover, of the mammal's brain is the development of regular fissures
  upon its surface, which fissures are only absent from
  <i>Ornithorhynchus</i>, various small Rodents, Bats, and Insectivores,
  among living mammals. It is sometimes, but erroneously, said that the
  more complicated the fissures of the brain are, the higher in
  intelligence and "zoological position" is the possessor of that brain.
  Instances can undoubtedly be quoted to support such a view; but they are
  <!-- Page 77 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page77"></a>{77}</span>merely selected cases, which do not indicate
  a wide applicability of such a generalisation. Thus it is true that the
  brain of a Man is more elaborate in its furrows and convolutions than is
  that of a Cat. The real fact of the matter is, that the complexity of the
  brain from this point of view increases with the size of the animal
  within the group.</p>

  <p>The Gorilla and the Chimpanzee have a more furrowed brain than has the
  little Marmoset; the Bear a more complicated brain than the Weasel, etc.
  The most highly-convoluted brains of all mammals are those of the
  Elephants, and there does not seem in the Ungulates to be so marked a
  relation between size and abundance of fissures as there is among other
  mammals. A regular plan of the fissures can be detected with certainty
  for each group considered by itself; but it is not so easy to homologise
  the details of arrangement from group to group. This is so far in accord
  with the view that the existing groups of mammals have diverged from each
  other <i>ab initio</i>.</p>

  <p>Another marked characteristic of the mammalian as opposed to other
  brains is the relatively small importance in size and yet the fourfold
  nature of the optic lobes. What was the case with the optic lobes of the
  early Ungulates is difficult to understand, on account of the fact that
  the casts are necessarily imperfect. <!-- Page 78 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page78"></a>{78}</span>Altogether the enormous
  progress in the complexity of the brain from the early Tertiary mammals
  down to the present, is one of the most remarkable revelations of
  palaeontology. It goes perhaps some way in explaining the remarkable
  diversity in mode of life exhibited by the mammals as compared, for
  example, with the birds, whose brains have not diverged so much or in so
  many directions from the primitive form.</p>

  <p><b>The present Distribution of the Mammalia.</b>&mdash;In the
  following pages some of the principal facts in the geographical range of
  the orders, families, and many of the genera of Mammalia will be given.
  It has been justly observed by Mr. Sclater that the habitat of an animal
  is as much a part of its definition as is its structure or external form.
  No systematic account of the Mammalia would therefore be complete without
  such geographical facts. But that branch of zoology which is concerned
  with the past and present distribution of animals is wider in scope than
  this. Zoogeography deals not only with the actual facts in the range of
  animals, but with the inferences as to past changes in the relations of
  land and sea which the facts seem to indicate, and with speculations as
  to the place of origin of the different groups, of which more than hints
  are sometimes given by their past and present distribution. In addition
  to this, the earth can be mapped out into provinces and regions which are
  definable by their animal inhabitants. In the present volume, dealing
  only with the Mammalia, it will be obviously impossible to enter fully
  into the entire subject of zoogeography. All that will be attempted is a
  brief general survey of the science so far as it can be illustrated by
  the Mammalia. For fuller knowledge the reader is referred to the
  treatises mentioned below.<a name="NtA_41"
  href="#Nt_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

  <p>There are certain facts in the distribution of animals which are
  commonplaces of knowledge, but which may be set forth with definiteness.
  Everybody knows that an animal has a given range: Elephants, for example,
  are found in India and certain adjacent parts of Asia, and again in
  Africa; the Rhinoceroses have roughly the same range; the Tiger is
  limited to Asia; the <!-- Page 79 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page79"></a>{79}</span>Jaguar to America, and so forth. The entire
  expanse of country which is inhabited by an animal is called its area of
  distribution. Such areas are larger or smaller. The Lion ranges over the
  whole of Africa, a small part of India, and some neighbouring countries;
  on the other hand, the Insectivore <i>Solenodon</i> is limited to Cuba
  and Hayti, a separate species to each. Among other groups of animals are
  instances of an even more restricted range. There are humming-birds
  confined to the slopes of a single mountain, and fishes limited in their
  range to a single small lake.</p>

  <p>A species may be found everywhere within the area of its distribution,
  or it may be confined to a number of limited tracts within that area. In
  this case it is usual to speak of "stations." In such cases the species
  in question is generally suited to some particular kind of environment.
  Thus the Otter and other aquatic mammals will only be found where there
  is water; and intervening tracts of waterless country will contain no
  Otters. Goats and Chamois live only upon mountains; the intervening
  plains are destitute of them. This discontinuity of distribution within
  the area is very general. But a discontinuity of area is also
  seen&mdash;not so commonly however; and, indeed, when it does occur, it
  is a matter of a genus and not of a species. Thus the Tapir is found in
  the East Indies on the one hand and in South and Central America on the
  other, being absent in the intermediate tracts.</p>

  <p>It is clear that tracts of country eminently suitable for the housing
  of a particular mammal do not always possess that kind, or even an allied
  form. Africa, for example, possesses no arboreal Anteaters; there are no
  Anteaters at all (of the order Edentata) in Australia, though there are
  plenty of ants for them to feed upon, and tropical conditions of climate
  prevail. But as in these cases the inference may be denied on the grounds
  that no experiments exist to prove or to disprove the assertion, the
  matter may be better emphasised by such cases as the introduction of the
  Rabbit into Australia, and various mammals, such as Goats, into oceanic
  islands. The plague caused by the former is a matter of notoriety. But
  although climate and conditions and animal inhabitants do not march
  accurately together, there is certainly some connexion between
  temperature and the range of animals. Mr. Lydekker writes on this point
  as follows: "The llama-like animals, respectively known as vicunas and
  guanacos, are met with in <!-- Page 80 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page80"></a>{80}</span>company on the highlands of the Cordillera
  in Peru and Ecuador, but as we go farther south the latter are found on
  the plains of southern Argentina and Patagonia, as well as on the island
  of Tierra del Fuego at the sea level. Here then is a clear proof of the
  intimate connexion existing between temperature and station; the guanaco
  being an animal which can only live in cold or temperate climates, finds
  suitable conditions for its existence in tropical latitudes solely at a
  height of so many thousands of feet, although farther south it is able to
  thrive at the sea level." This, however, cannot be pushed too
  far&mdash;the world cannot be mapped out into areas bounded by parallels
  of temperature as was once attempted&mdash;since there are plenty of
  cases like that of the Tiger, which is as much at home in a tropical
  jungle as on the icy plains of Northern Asia.</p>

  <p>Seeing that there are in many cases no climatic barriers to the
  spreading of a given race of animals over a larger area of distribution
  than it actually occupies, it becomes important to inquire why there are
  so many cases of restriction in range.</p>

  <p>It is possible to see, at any rate, three causes which are responsible
  for a large number of such cases. In the first place, a given species of
  animal must have originated at a certain spot; its multiplication in
  individuals must always be a slow matter, since enemies, and untoward
  events generally, would conspire to check the natural multiplication by
  geometrical progression. A long time might therefore elapse before the
  species greatly extended its range. A restricted distribution may
  therefore, in some cases, mean a modern race. In the second place, there
  are definite physical barriers which check the migration of species. The
  terrestrial Mammalia cannot cross wide arms of the sea; that they can and
  do swim for considerable distances has been proved in several instances;
  but, as has been pointed out, it is unlikely that a purely terrestrial
  mammal would voluntarily swim out into an unknown sea. And then if it
  did, and successfully reached the opposite side, nothing would happen
  unless it were a pregnant female; or, if not pregnant, till a male swam
  very soon afterwards in exactly the same direction. Many travellers have
  told of floating islands, formed of torn-up trees and brushwood, which
  have been seen at the mouths of large rivers, with animal passengers upon
  them. These are, however, so much at the mercy of currents and storms,
  <!-- Page 81 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page81"></a>{81}</span>that but little reliance can be placed on
  them as a means of transit; besides, here again, two individuals, or a
  pregnant female, would be required to effect a settlement on a foreign
  shore. The existence of oceanic islands is often urged as a proof of this
  inability to cross tracts of sea; even those which are comparatively near
  an extensive continent, such as, for example, Fernando Noronha in the
  Atlantic, are destitute of mammals (except, indeed, the ubiquitous Mouse,
  which is believed to have been carried there, often in company with the
  equally widely-spread Rat, in ships). This argument, however, is not so
  conclusive as might appear; it doubtless is in the case of far-distant
  islands. But the size of the islands has to be taken into account. For
  there are islands, such as the Galapagos, or, to take a less contested
  instance, some of the islands of the Malagasy Archipelago, undoubtedly
  continental, which have an exceedingly reduced number of mammals. An area
  of a certain size seems to be a necessity.</p>

  <p>The converse of this is in many cases easy to show, that is, the wide
  range of animals when there are no marine barriers to stop their
  spreading. John Hunter, the celebrated anatomist and surgeon (not often
  quoted, however, as an authority upon geographical distribution),
  observes: "It is a curious circumstance in the natural history of animals
  to find most of the northern animals the same both on the continent of
  America and what is called the Old World, while those of the warmer parts
  of both continents are not so. Thus we find the bear, fox, wolf, elk,
  reindeer, ptarmigan, etc., in the northern parts of both.... The reason
  why the same animals are to be found in the northern parts is the
  nearness of the two continents. They are so near as to be within the
  power of accident to bring the animals, especially the large ones, from
  one continent to the other either on the ice or even by water. But the
  continents diverging from each other southward, so as to be at a very
  considerable distance from each other even beyond the flight of birds, is
  the reason why the quadrupeds are not the same."</p>

  <p>There is no doubt, in fact, that the ocean is the most insuperable of
  all barriers to the dispersal of mammals. In a less degree mountain
  ranges and deserts are also barriers. The Desert of Sahara is a striking
  instance to the point; it separates two exceedingly different faunas.
  <!-- Page 82 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page82"></a>{82}</span></p>

  <p>A third cause of more or less limited range is the barrier due to
  competition. If the ground is already taken up, there is no room for new
  immigrants. There is obviously a limit to the number of Antelopes or Deer
  that can graze upon a given tract of grassy plain. These two groups of
  Ungulates illustrate the matter well: the Antelopes are African and
  Indian, especially the former, while Africa has no Deer at all; America,
  on the other hand, has plenty of Deer but no Antelopes, save the
  Prong-horn. The more nearly akin the two species or groups of species
  are, the fiercer will be the competition; for a near kinship will at
  least often imply similar habits, the need for similar food, and other
  likenesses which will prevent both from successfully occupying the same
  tract of country. The remarkable fauna of Australia is believed to afford
  an example of this. In that country the prevalent inhabitants are the
  Marsupials. The Monotremes are found there also, and nowhere else save in
  New Guinea and Tasmania. The remaining mammals are inconspicuous; they
  embrace a few Rodents and Bats, and the doubtfully indigenous Dingo-dog.
  Now the Marsupials are fitted to every variety of life. We have the
  grazing Kangaroos and Wallabies, the burrowing Wombats, the arboreal
  Phalangers, and the carnivorous Dasyures. In the second place, it is an
  unquestioned fact that the Marsupials are an older race than are the
  existing Eutherian mammals; they were the dominant mammals during the
  Secondary epoch. At that time they were more widely distributed than at
  present. In most parts of the world they are now absent, since they have
  been successfully ousted by the more highly organised groups of Eutheria.
  But at that period, when the higher Eutheria were in the ascendant,
  Australia and the islands to the north became cut off from Asia, and thus
  became freed from inroads of Eutheria, which were partly prevented by the
  physical barrier of the sea from effecting a settlement, and partly
  perhaps prevented owing to the ground being already taken up by the
  Marsupials. Likeness of habit gave the older inhabitants victory in the
  struggle for existence.</p>

  <p>The general statements that have been here made are in accord with
  current opinion upon the factors of geographical distribution. But the
  past range of animals appears to be less consonant with the received
  views. In the Tertiary <!-- Page 83 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page83"></a>{83}</span>period, groups of animals had often a far
  wider range than at present. To-day the Rhinoceroses are limited to Asia
  and Africa, and to quite limited parts of the former continent. In the
  past, these animals were abundant in Europe and North America. Wild
  Horses now have a range which is not widely different from that of the
  Rhinoceroses, save that they extend into the more northern regions of
  Asia. Their remains are abundant both in North and South America. The
  Hippopotamus, now confined to Africa, once ranged over Europe,
  Madagascar, and India. There were plenty of American and European Lemurs.
  Elephants were nearly world-wide in their range; and, in short,
  restricted distribution seems to be on the whole a characteristic of
  animals of the present day.</p>

  <p>These statements, however, though perfectly true, must not lead to
  erroneous inferences. It is rather impressed upon the reader, in books
  which contain sections dealing with geographical distribution, that
  animals on the whole occupy more restricted areas at present than in the
  past. There are, however, plenty of examples of groups of extinct
  creatures which had, so far as we know, quite a restricted range. Thus
  the Toxodonts were purely South American, as were the Glyptodonts and
  some other forms. And, on the other hand, the Cervidae of to-day are as
  widely, if not more widely, distributed than at any other time. The Hares
  and Rabbits are now nearly universal in range; the Cats almost so. We
  meet with Bovidae, even excluding the Sheep and Goats, in all the four
  quarters of the globe, excluding only South America and, of course,
  Australia. The Camelidae are still common to both the Old and the New
  Worlds.</p>

  <p>During certain periods of the Tertiary epoch it is true that there was
  more similarity between Europe and North America than there is at
  present. It would have been quite necessary to unite both into a
  Holarctic area, such as is now insisted upon by many; but the reasons for
  this union would then have been stronger. The fact is, however, that the
  closer resemblances were due to the larger number of families of animals
  which existed then than now; these have decayed away from both
  continents, and allowed the unlikenesses between the mammalian fauna of
  both to become evident. But the likenesses which still survive have led
  many to associate the two regions closely together.</p>

  <p>So far as the history of a genus or family or larger division <!--
  Page 84 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page84"></a>{84}</span>can be
  traced, it results as a conclusion that from a given area of origin the
  group in question migrated in all directions where possible to a varying
  degree; it then died out in intervening tracts, or was left only in a
  certain part of its former and more extensive area of range.</p>

  <p><b>Zoological Regions.</b>&mdash;Seeing that each species of animal
  has its own definite range, it is clear that the earth's surface can be
  apportioned into divisions which are characterised by their animal
  inhabitants. We shall divide the earth into realms, which are the largest
  divisions; then into regions; and finally into subregions. It must be
  borne in mind that the various groups of the animal kingdom are of
  different ages, geologically speaking, and have therefore had less or
  more time, as the case may be, to settle down into their present
  distribution, and that different animals differ greatly in their rate of
  multiplication, their power of migration, and their susceptibility to the
  effectiveness of various natural and other barriers to distribution. It
  is not, therefore, possible to divide the world into realms and regions
  which shall express the facts of distribution of the entire animal
  kingdom. Such divisions, which are common in text-books of zoology having
  but a small section devoted to zoogeography, are at best mere
  approximations and averages; no good is gained by taking such a
  comprehensive view of the matter, as the essential object of subdividing
  the earth's surface is thereby lost sight of. The zoogeographical
  division of the earth which will be adopted here is that originally
  recommended by Dr. Blanford, and now accepted by a number of authorities.
  There are three "realms," to which a fourth may perhaps be
  added&mdash;though on negative grounds, and merely for the purpose of
  emphasising the parts of the world to which mammals have not gained
  access. The realms are again divisible into regions, at least in the case
  of one of them, and the regions may be again separated into more or less
  distinct subregions or provinces. The three primary divisions or realms
  which contain mammals are the Notogaean, including Australia and certain
  islands to the north of it; the Neogaean, or the South American continent
  and Central America; the Arctogaean, including the continents of North
  America, Europe, Asia, and Africa, together with the adjacent islands,
  such as the West Indies, East Indies (exclusive of those which fall
  within <!-- Page 85 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page85"></a>{85}</span>the realm of Notogaea), and Madagascar; and
  finally, the realm of Antarctogaea or Atheriogaea, which embraces New
  Zealand, the Antarctic continent, and a series of islands such as South
  Georgia and Kerguelen, and possibly even the extreme south of Patagonia.
  This latter quarter of the globe will need no further reference, as it
  has no truly indigenous terrestrial mammalian inhabitants. We cannot
  include the Bats in this statement, as their distribution is due to
  different powers of extending their range, and to different barriers from
  those which govern the range of other groups of mammals.</p>

  <p>(1) Notogaea.<a name="NtA_42" href="#Nt_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> This
  realm is characterised by the exclusive possession of the Monotremes<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span>that is to say, one of the two primary
  divisions of the Mammalia is absolutely restricted to this area. It
  contains, moreover, the vast majority of the Marsupials. Further, the
  realm of Notogaea is to be distinguished by the entire absence of the
  higher mammals, with the exception of a few small Rodents. (The Bats are
  ignored for the reasons stated, and the Dingo is believed to have been an
  importation.) It cannot be disputed that this is a very distinctly-marked
  area of the earth's surface.</p>

  <p>(2) Neogaea. The continent of South America has no Monotremes and only
  a few Marsupials, all of which, with the exception of <i>Caenolestes</i>,
  belong to the Polyprotodont division of that order, and to a peculiar
  family, Didelphyidae. The recent discovery of other fossil Marsupials,
  however, to some extent favours Huxley's view that Neogaea and Notogaea
  form one realm as opposed to the rest of the world. Besides this, Neogaea
  possesses the Edentata, which are found nowhere else;&mdash;that is, the
  division of the Edentata to which the name is now restricted by some
  authorities. It is also characterised by the nearly entire absence of the
  important order of Insectivora; and, as minor marks of distinction, by
  the absence of Antelopes, Oxen and Sheep, of the Ichneumon tribe, of
  Horses, and of Lemurs. It has the exclusive possession of the Hapalidae
  and Cebidae, and of several families of Rodents.</p>

  <p>(3) Arctogaea. This vast realm is clearly capable of subdivision into
  four regions, which will be considered in detail later. In the meantime
  the points of likeness between these subdivisions is more marked than are
  either the resemblances or the <!-- Page 86 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page86"></a>{86}</span>differences of any one of them to either of
  the two realms which have just been defined. The two realms that have
  been discussed retain their distinctness from each other and from
  Arctogaea for a considerable way back into the Tertiary period. It is not
  until we reach very early Tertiary times that Edentates are met with in
  North America; and then it cannot be regarded as absolutely settled that
  the Ganodonta are really the forerunners of the Armadillos, Sloths, etc.
  Nor do we find Marsupials in Europe until far back in time, and at a
  corresponding period in North America. Indeed the fauna of South America
  in late Tertiary times was even more distinct than it is now; for then we
  had confined to that region the Toxodonts, Glyptodonts,
  <i>Macrauchenia</i>, and other forms, while in Australia there were still
  Marsupials. In late Tertiary times Europe and India were by no means so
  distinct from Africa as they are to-day. North America does not resemble
  the Old World quite so much as the subdivisions of the Old World resemble
  each other; but, as will be pointed out later, there are and were very
  substantial agreements. The Elephants, Rhinoceroses, Giraffe,
  Hippopotamus, <i>Orycteropus</i>, are now distinctively African or Indian
  animals; but all these genera, or at least families (in the case of the
  Giraffe), have occurred in Europe during quite recent times.
  <i>Lycaon</i> indeed, now confined to Africa, is thought to have had a
  European origin from its occurrence in caves there. The Hyaena and the
  Lion, certain members of the Horse tribe, Apes, and other animals, were
  also but are not now European.</p>

  <p>India again, and the Oriental region generally, once possessed the
  Hippopotamus, the Chimpanzee, Giraffidae, the Antelopes, <i>Cobus</i>,
  <i>Hippotragus</i>, <i>Strepsiceros</i>, and <i>Orias</i>, which are now
  purely African animals. It shares at present with the Ethiopian region
  the Catarhines, including the Anthropoid Apes, the Lemurs, Tragulina (the
  genus <i>Dorcatherium</i> is also known from fossils in India),
  <i>Manis</i>, <i>Hyaena</i>, the Cheetah, Elephant, Rhinoceros, and the
  Ratel. There is, in fact, no order of mammals which is now absent from
  one of these three regions though present in the others, save the Lemurs,
  and they occurred in past times in Europe. The Tapir of India is known
  fossil in Europe, and the latter continent had its Monkeys and even
  Anthropoids. On the other hand, North America is more distinct. It has no
  Lemurs, Apes, Elephants, Rhinoceroses, Tapirs, Old World Edentates <!--
  Page 87 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page87"></a>{87}</span>(Effodientia), Viverridae, Horses, or
  Antelopes, excepting <i>Antilocapra</i>, a type of a separate division of
  Bovidae. But since several of these groups have been represented in
  recent times, no primary line of division can be profitably drawn.</p>

  <p>Arctogaea as a whole may be characterised by both negative and
  positive characters. As negative features may be mentioned;&mdash;the
  entire absence of Edentates (<i>Necrodasypus</i> of Filhol is rather
  doubtful, see p. <a href="#page164">164</a>, n.), though a few crept up
  into the Nearctic region from Neogaea during past times; and of
  Hapalidae, Cebidae, and Marsupials, except an Opossum in North America.
  This realm has, on the other hand, all the Lemurs, all the Insectivores
  with the exception of the West Indian <i>Solenodon</i>, all the
  Proboscidea, Rhinoceroses, Horses, Deer, Antelopes, the last group
  including the Oxen and a variety of other important families. It is in
  fact the headquarters of all the Eutheria with the exception of the
  Edentata and Marsupials.</p>

  <p>The subdivisions of this realm have been variously effected. The
  classical subdivisions are of course those of Mr. Sclater, who would
  recognise (1) the Nearctic, North America; (2) the Palaearctic, including
  Europe, Northern Asia, and Japan; (3) the Oriental, including Asia south
  of the Himalayas and the islands of the Malay Archipelago as far east as
  the Australian region; and (4) the Ethiopian, <i>i.e.</i> tropical Africa
  and Madagascar. Some would alter this by uniting America and the north of
  the Old World into a Holarctic region, separating off the southern parts
  of the North American continent into a Sonoran region. To some, the
  claims of Madagascar to form a separate region are convincing. To
  distinguish the boundaries of the several regions is a difficult task;
  they dovetail into each other on the frontiers with the complex curves of
  a puzzle-map. The difficulty has been grappled with by the suggestion of
  intermediate transitional areas; but this proceeding really doubles the
  difficulty, for there are then two frontiers to delimit in each case
  instead of only one. The animal inhabitants must be expected to mingle
  somewhat at the lines of junction of one region with another.</p>

  <p>The Sonoran region does not appear to us to have great claims to
  recognition. It shows a mingling of southern with northern forms exactly
  as might be expected. An Armadillo and <i>Didelphys</i> have, as it is
  believed, invaded it from the Neogaeic realm; it possesses also the South
  American genera, <i>Dicotyles</i>, <i>Nasua</i>, <!-- Page 88 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page88"></a>{88}</span><i>Conepatus</i>,
  <i>Sigmodon</i>. On the other hand, the Sonoran genera
  <i>Antilocapra</i>, <i>Cynomys</i>, <i>Procyon</i>, and the Insectivora
  <i>Blarina</i> and <i>Scapanus</i>, extend further north. Peculiar to
  this region are only six genera of Rodents, which seems an insufficient
  reason for raising the Sonoran province to the dignity of a region.
  Considered from the point of view of numbers of peculiar forms, the
  Thibetan subregion has more claims to distinction as a region; for
  confined to that area we have the genera <i>Nectogale</i>,
  <i>Aeluropus</i>, <i>Eupetaurus</i>, <i>Pantholops</i>, <i>Budorcas</i>;
  while by slightly extending its limits, a number of other peculiar forms
  might be added. Madagascar has distinctly more claims to regional
  division. Absolutely confined to it are eleven of the seventeen existing
  genera of Lemurs, the family Centetidae among the Insectivora, which
  contains seven genera, and another recently discovered and peculiar
  genus, <i>Geogale</i>; it has six peculiar genera of Viverridae; it has
  five peculiar genera of Rodents. In addition to this it is negatively
  characterised by the absence of the following typical African animals,
  Felidae, Proboscidea, Rhinocerotidae, Equidae, Monkeys, etc. It seems to
  be impossible to avoid allowing the rank of a region to this part of the
  world.</p>

  <p>In separating the Nearctic from the Palaearctic region, stress must be
  laid rather upon the absence of Asiatic and European forms from North
  America than upon the existence in the northern half of the New World of
  many peculiar forms. Peculiar to the Nearctic are the Goat genus
  <i>Haploceros</i>, the Rodents <i>Erethizon</i>, <i>Zapus</i>, and the
  family Haplodontidae. The Mole genus <i>Condylura</i> is also restricted
  to this part of the New World. Even so it has more peculiar forms than
  the Sonoran. If we add to this the absence of Horses, Antelopes except
  <i>Antilocapra</i>, Pigs, Hyaenas, etc., there are strong grounds for
  retaining this division. It must be agreed, however, that it comes rather
  nearer to the Eurasian district than the latter does to the Oriental.</p>

  <p>The Oriental region has many characteristic animals. It has among the
  Anthropoid Apes the Orangs and Gibbons; of Old World Apes it has confined
  to its own area the genera <i>Semnopithecus</i> and <i>Nasalis</i>. Of
  Lemurs there are <i>Loris</i> and <i>Nycticebus</i>, and <i>Tarsius</i>,
  representing a family of that order, or even a sub-order. The
  Galeopithecidae are entirely Malayan. There are many Rodent, Carnivorous,
  and Insectivorous genera; the Rhinoceroses and the Elephant of this
  region differ from those of Africa. <!-- Page 89 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page89"></a>{89}</span><i>Tragulus</i> concludes
  a sample from a very rich list of peculiar forms.</p>

  <p>The Ethiopian region has also its Anthropoids, the Gorilla and the
  Chimpanzee, but they belong to genera or a genus different from those
  which include the Oriental forms. There are five peculiar genera of
  Cercopithecidae. The Lemurs restricted to this region are <i>Galago</i>,
  <i>Perodicticus</i> and <i>Arctocebus</i>. The peculiar Insectivorous
  families Macroscelidae and Chrysochloridae are only found here, besides
  many other peculiar genera. Africa is especially the home of Antelopes,
  and the Giraffe is not found now outside its borders. The Elephant and
  the Rhinoceroses are of different species from those of India. There are
  many peculiar Rodents and Ungulates.</p>

<h6>THE POSSIBLE FORERUNNERS OF THE MAMMALIA</h6>

  <p>The relationship of Mammals to Vertebrates lying below them in the
  scale, their origin in fact, is a much-debated question, with many
  attempted solutions. To enter into this large question in detail would
  involve a great deal of useless statement of arguments founded upon
  misleading or upon quite inaccurate "facts." It will perhaps be
  sufficient if we reflect here the current view most in vogue at the
  present, <i>i.e.</i> that which would refer the Mammalia to reptiles
  belonging to the extinct Permian and Triassic group of the Theromorpha
  (also called Anomodontia). These have been explored lately to a very
  large extent, and chiefly by Professor Seeley.<a name="NtA_43"
  href="#Nt_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> The very fact that a genus
  <i>Tritylodon</i>, only known by the forepart of the skull, has been
  called Mammalian and Anomodont by various authors, shows at least the
  difficulty of differentiating the two groups when the material for study
  is imperfect. As a matter of fact these Theromorpha are without doubt
  reptiles; they show, for example, a lower jaw formed out of several
  distinct pieces, of which the articular articulates with a fixed quadrate
  on the skull. They possess the characteristic reptilian bones, the
  "transverse," the pre- and post-frontals, and there are various other
  points of structure which leave no room for doubt as to their truly
  reptilian nature. There are, however, numerous indications of an
  evolution in the mammalian direction in all parts of the skeleton, to the
  more important of which some reference will be made here. It may be as
  well to clear the <!-- Page 91 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page91"></a>{91}</span>ground by mentioning the fact that among the
  Theromorpha four distinct types of reptiles are included, which are
  considered to form four orders, <i>i.e.</i> the Pareiasauri, the
  Theriodontia, the Anomodontia (Dicynodontia), and the Placodontia.</p>

  <p>The first of these divisions includes what seem to be basal forms.
  These reptiles show numerous points of likeness to the Amphibian
  Labyrinthodonts.<a name="NtA_44" href="#Nt_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a> On the
  other hand the third division, that of the Dicynodontia, are
  highly-specialised Theromorpha, from which no further evolution would
  appear to have been possible. Thus the dentition was either completely
  lost, or reduced to tusks as in <i>Dicynodon</i>. We need not therefore
  concern ourselves in the present volume with these Anomodonts. It is with
  the Theriodonts that our business lies. The very name, be it observed, is
  aptly chosen on the hypothesis to be explained here; but it is not only
  in the teeth that these reptiles show likenesses to the Theria or
  Mammals, but in almost every feature of their organisation. Unlike other
  reptiles, the Theromorpha in general were lifted comparatively high above
  the ground on legs of fair length and of mammalian relationship in the
  position of the segments of the limbs. The typical reptile grovels upon
  the earth with legs sprawling out, as indeed the very name suggests. One
  bar to the Theriodonts being on the direct line of mammalian ancestry has
  been urged as a preliminary difficulty, and that is their large size. The
  earliest undoubted mammals were small creatures, comparable to a Rat or a
  Mouse in size; whereas a good-sized Bear or a Wolf is a better standard
  of size for some of the best-known genera of Theriodonts. It has,
  however, been quite permissibly suggested that living in company with
  these large Theriodonts were less obtrusive genera, from which the
  mammals might have sprung. It is so familiar a fact that a given group of
  animals generally contains giants, dwarfs, and members of intermediate
  size, that this suggestion may almost be accepted as a fact. It need at
  least present no difficulties to us in our comparisons.</p>

  <p>The most salient "mammalian" feature of the Theriodonts is the
  heterodonty of the teeth, the pattern of the "molars," and the limited
  number which constitute the series. The fact, too, that they are limited
  to the dentary bones below and to the <!-- Page 92 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page92"></a>{92}</span>maxillae and the
  premaxillae above, is a <i>sine qua non</i> for mammalian comparison. In
  the more basal Theromorpha the teeth are not so limited in position.
  Finally, to complete the remarkable mammalian resemblance of the teeth of
  these reptiles, it must be mentioned that in <i>Tritylodon</i> and
  <i>Diademodon</i> the roots of the molars, as we may fairly term them,
  though not actually divided after the mammalian fashion, were deeply
  marked by a groove, which suggests an incipient division or a fusion of
  two distinct roots. Some of these facts of structure may now be
  considered in further detail. As to the incisors and canines, it is
  sufficient to say that the numbers of the former, and the shape of the
  latter, are in perfect consonance with a derivation of the Mammalia from
  this group. The molar series can be divided into premolars and molars, at
  least in so far as regards their shape; for the anterior teeth are often
  smaller and less complicated than those which follow, as is often the
  case with the two series in mammals. The molar series also consist of
  teeth in close apposition to each other and separated from the canines by
  a diastema, which is a character of mammalian teeth. The fact that in the
  reptile <i>Cynognathus</i> and the mammal <i>Myrmecobius</i> there are
  nine of these molar teeth in each half of each jaw is perhaps not a point
  upon which it is desirable to dwell with too much weight; but the general
  fact that the molars are further reduced in some genera of Theriodontia
  than in that which has been mentioned, is clearly a matter of
  significance when the ancestry of the mammals is under consideration.</p>

  <p>The most interesting fact about the molar series in the Theriodontia
  is that we meet with the two types of molars that occur in the mammals.
  <i>Cynognathus</i> and other genera have molars which consist of a main
  cusp, and of one cusp before and one after the main cusp; in fact these
  teeth are triconodont as in certain early mammals, a state of affairs
  which is believed by the "trituberculists" (see p. <a
  href="#page56">56</a>) to have preceded the tritubercular tooth. There
  are also "multitubercular" teeth, especially well developed in
  <i>Tritylodon</i>, where they exactly resemble those of certain
  Multituberculata, and whose structure originally led to the placing of
  <i>Tritylodon</i> among the mammals of that group. If there is any
  question about the mammalian nature of this fossil, there remain several
  other Theriodontia in which the multituberculism is well marked. It is so
  in <i>Trirhackodon</i> <!-- Page 93 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page93"></a>{93}</span>and in <i>Diademodon</i> for instance. This
  incidentally lends some support to the idea that the Mammalia have been
  evolved from two sources, a way of looking at the origin of the group
  that will coincide with the views of some authors like the late Dr.
  Mivart, and will at the same time reconcile the trituberculists and the
  multituberculists. For we should then assume that the Eutheria and
  Triconodontia had originated from some such form as <i>Cynognathus</i>;
  and the Multituberculata and the existing Monotremes from some form like
  <i>Diademodon</i>. It is not of great use to point out that
  <i>Diademodon</i> is really of the trituberculate pattern, because in its
  molars, though multituberculate, the trituberculate main cones can be
  recognised; for that state of affairs could just as well have been
  brought about by a reduction from the multituberculate type. The skull of
  these Theriodonts shows some well-marked approximations to the mammalian
  type. There is in the first place a commencing consolidation and
  reduction of the individual bones, which is so distinguishing a feature
  of the mammalian skull as opposed to the skull of lower vertebrates. In
  <i>Cynognathus</i> the postorbital is fused with the jugal, and the
  supratemporal with the squamosal, forming apparently one bone. In the
  lower jaw the splenial is often reduced to the thinness of paper, thus
  indicating a commencing disappearance. In many Theromorpha the squamosal
  shares largely in the formation of the articular facet for the lower jaw,
  obviously an important mammalian characteristic; this is brought about by
  the reduction of the quadrate, which latter bone, moreover, acquires in
  certain particulars the appearance of the mammalian malleus, with which
  it is, according to many, homologous. But this subject has been already
  dealt with on page <a href="#page26">26</a>. A very pronounced likeness
  to the mammalian skull is that there are two occipital condyles. That
  this has been brought about by the further development of a tripartite
  condyle such as occurs in tortoises, and that by the suppression of the
  basi-occipital part, does not affect the resemblance to the mammalian
  skull; in fact it explains the origin of two condyles from the typical
  reptilian single condyle, and disposes of the necessity for believing,
  with Huxley and others, the Amphibia to be on the main line of mammalian
  evolution on account of their two condyles. The general aspect of the
  skull in <i>Cynognathus</i> has been <!-- Page 94 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page94"></a>{94}</span>compared to that "of
  <i>Thylacinus</i> or <i>Dissacus</i>." No one can examine the actual
  sketches of the skull of that Theriodont without endorsing that opinion.
  As a curious detailed point of likeness to certain Mammalia may be
  mentioned "a small descending process of the malar bone, which may be a
  diminutive representative of the descending element of the malar seen in
  <i>Elotherium</i>, <i>Nototherium</i>, <i>Diprotodon</i>,
  <i>Macropus</i>, certain Edentata, such as <i>Glyptodon</i>,
  <i>Megatherium</i>, <i>Mylodon</i>, <i>Bradypus</i>, but unparalleled so
  far as I am aware in fossil reptiles." (Osborn.) The zoologist cannot
  help being impressed with the significance of small details of
  similarity, which do not seem to be due in any way to surrounding
  conditions of life, and thus referable to mere convergence, like the
  fish-like form of Whales and Seals.</p>

  <p>The rest of the skeleton of the Theriodontia is by no means so well
  known as the skull and teeth. But from what is known, other mammalian
  characters can be pointed out. Perhaps the most striking mammalian
  feature is to be found in the scapula of <i>Cynognathus</i>. It is in
  this creature somewhat narrow and elongated; but it has a well-marked
  spine, ending in a hooked acromion. Now it is to be noted in support, so
  far, of the diphyletic origin of mammals, that in the Monotreme, as in
  Whales indeed, the spine forms the anterior border of the scapula, and is
  coincident with it, there being thus no prescapula at all in the
  Monotreme, and only a trace of it in certain Whales.<a name="NtA_45"
  href="#Nt_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a> Whether the multituberculate
  <i>Tritylodon</i> or <i>Diademodon</i> had a scapula after the Monotreme
  pattern is not known; but it is clear that the scapula of the triconodont
  <i>Cynognathus</i> is quite after the pattern of the Eutherian scapula.
  Furthermore, Professor Seeley is of opinion that the coracoid was
  relatively small, and indeed smaller than the same bone in Edentates, and
  <i>a fortiori</i> than in Monotremes. Another fact of structure which
  points also, possibly, in the direction of a diphyletic origin for the
  Mammalia, is the double-headed ribs of <i>Cynognathus</i>. As is well
  known, the ribs of the Monotremata have only the central head, the
  capitulum.</p>

  <p>As a general mark of affinity with mammals the reduction of the
  intercentra in <i>Cynognathus</i> may be noted, and also the existence of
  a small though perfectly obvious obturator-foramen, separating the pubis
  from the ischium. There are further details <!-- Page 95 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page95"></a>{95}</span>which tend in the same
  direction. And we shall probably not go far wrong in the present state of
  our knowledge if we assign the origin of the mammals to some type which
  would be included in the order Theriodontia or at least in the sub-class
  Theromorpha.</p>

<h5 class="lg150">CHAPTER IV</h5>

<h6>THE DAWN OF MAMMALIAN LIFE</h6>

  <p>The animals that we considered in the last chapter, though showing
  certain unmistakable likenesses to the mammals, are nevertheless
  unquestionably not mammals but reptiles. In the Triassic strata, however,
  we first meet with the remains of undoubted mammals. The Mammalia first
  appeared upon the earth in a tentative and hesitating way: they had not
  cast off many of the characters of their supposed reptilian forefathers;
  they shrank from observation and destruction by their small size, and
  apparently, so far at any rate as their teeth afford a clue, by an
  omnivorous diet. The world abounded at that period in large and
  carnivorous reptiles, which may indeed have been the principal enemies
  with which the first mammals had to cope. These early mammals lingered on
  to so late a period as the Eocene; but the majority of the genera were
  Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous. Certain of the primitive mammalian
  forms have been referred to the Marsupials, and their resemblances to the
  Monotremata have also been pointed out. The current view of the present
  time, however, is that they form a special order, which may possibly have
  embraced the ancestors of both Marsupials and Monotremes; for it is
  reasonable to explain in this way the combination of characters of these
  two orders which they present. For this group the name Allotheria has
  been proposed by Marsh, and Multituberculata by Cope; the latter term is
  the less suitable, in that the Monotremata (<i>Ornithorhynchus</i>) are
  also "multituberculate." The group is known in a very imperfect fashion.
  The remains are but few and fragmentary; and for the most part we have
  only a few teeth to speculate upon. This is natural enough, for the
  harder teeth might easily be supposed to <!-- Page 97 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page97"></a>{97}</span>have resisted the decay
  which would more readily affect the softer bones. Where there are bones
  it is frequently the lower jaw alone which has been preserved for
  us&mdash;a bone which has also been preserved in the case of some of the
  contemporary Marsupials.</p>

  <p>It has been pointed out (from the observation of dead dogs floating in
  canals) that the lower jaw is occasionally detached from the carcase. It
  is the most readily separable part which contains a skeleton. It may be,
  therefore, that the remains of these early mammals, floating down some
  river to the sea, may have lost their jaws while in the river, or at
  furthest in the shallow waters of the sea, the rest of the carcase
  floating out to a greater distance, and being finally entombed in the
  stomach of some carnivorous fish, or in the mud at the bottom of a deep
  ocean, which has never since seen the light.</p>

  <p>The characters of this group are really more those of the Monotremata
  than of the Marsupials. The undoubted likeness which their molar teeth
  show to the temporary teeth of the Platypus have already been commented
  upon. Like the Monotremes the Allotheria appear to have possessed a large
  and independent coracoid; the evidence for this rests upon the discovery
  of the lower end of a scapula of <i>Camptomus</i>, a Cretaceous genus
  from North America upon which there is a distinct facet for the
  articulation of what can have been nothing else than a coracoid. On the
  other hand they differ from the Monotremata by the presence of incisor
  teeth which were Rodent-like in form, and not very different from those
  of certain Marsupials. This point of difference cannot be regarded as of
  very first-rate importance; no one would relegate the Sloth and the
  Armadillo to different orders on account of their tooth differences,
  which are about on a par with those to which we have just referred. It
  seems indeed likely that it will be ultimately necessary to rub out the
  boundary line which now divides the Allotheria and the Monotremata.</p>

  <p>The Plagiaulacidae are unquestionably mammals, and they are placed by
  most naturalists in this at present uncertain group of Multituberculata,
  which will be retained here in deference to the distinguished authorities
  who have instituted the group, though there are but few characters by
  which it can be defined. This family though appearing in the Trias,
  extends down in time to the Eocene. The type-genus, that which has given
  its name to <!-- Page 98 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page98"></a>{98}</span>the family, is <i>Plagiaulax</i>. As it is
  not Triassic, the consideration of its characters will be deferred until
  later. <i>Microlestes</i> is a Rhaetic genus, known from rocks in Germany
  and England; but it is entirely based upon molar teeth. <i>M.
  antiquus</i> has a two-rooted molar of an elongated form with a row of
  tubercles on either side of a median groove, which traverses the long
  axis of the tooth. To some extent the teeth of the ancient form resemble
  those of <i>Ornithorhynchus</i>. <i>Microlestes</i> has been sometimes
  spoken of as a Marsupial, but Mr. Tomes<a name="NtA_46"
  href="#Nt_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a> has found that it does not show one
  very universal character of the Marsupial teeth: it has not those
  continuations of the dentinal tubes which traverse the enamel in all
  Marsupials that have been examined with the sole exception of the
  Wombat.</p>

  <p>The rarity of the remains of mammals in these earliest rocks of the
  Secondary epoch has been accounted for in another way from that which has
  been suggested above. It may be that the group Mammalia was not evolved
  in Europe at all, and that the stray remains which have been found in
  that continent represent the fragmentary remnants of a few scattered
  immigrants which heralded the later invasion of more numerous genera
  during the Jurassic period.</p>

  <p><b>The Mammals of the Jurassic Period.</b>&mdash;Some of the
  Allotheria or Multituberculata described in the last section occur in the
  rocks of this early part of the Secondary epoch. They are doubtful in
  position, as already stated; some of them indeed, as for instance
  <i>Tritylodon</i> and <i>Dromatherium</i>, are possibly not mammals at
  all, while the remainder probably belong to a non-existent order of
  mammals. Along with these dubious creatures are the fragmentary remains
  of small animals which are not merely mammals, but in all probability
  definitely Marsupials. It is true that here again we have little beyond
  lower jaws and teeth to deal with; so that there may be less certainty in
  referring them to the Marsupials than appears to be the opinion of the
  majority of Palaeontologists.</p>

  <p>Professor Osborn in fact considers that the Mesozoic mammals consist
  of three groups: (1) The Multituberculata, including the Bolodontidae,
  Stereognathidae, Plagiaulacidae, Polymastodontidae, and possibly the
  Tritylodontidae (which, however, are regarded by him and by others as
  more probably reptiles of the <!-- Page 99 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page99"></a>{99}</span>Theromorphous group). (2) The Triconodonta,
  which were Marsupials, though in all probability with a complete
  succession of teeth and with an allantoic placentation. This group will
  include the genera <i>Phascolotherium</i> and <i>Amphilestes</i>, as well
  as <i>Triconodon</i> and <i>Spalacotherium</i>. Finally we have (3) the
  Trituberculata (or Insectivora Primitiva) with the genera
  <i>Amphitherium</i>, <i>Peramus</i>, <i>Amblotherium</i>,
  <i>Stylacodon</i>, and <i>Dryolestes</i>.</p>

  <p>We shall take these three groups in order. The Multituberculata have
  already been to some extent defined, if such a word can be used to
  express the summation of the very scanty information at our disposal. Of
  this group, <i>Plagiaulax</i> is a genus which occurs in the Purbeck
  beds; it is only known by lower jaws implying an animal of the size of a
  Rat or rather smaller. The jaws have in front a large incisor which looks
  Rodent-like, and also like those of the Diprotodont Marsupials; but it is
  held that these teeth did not grow from persistent pulps, and there is in
  any case no anterior thickened coating of enamel. Canines are absent; the
  diastema is followed by four premolars increasing progressively in size
  and possessing somewhat complicated grinding surfaces. These surfaces are
  formed by several obliquely-set ridges. The succeeding teeth are termed
  molars on account of their difference in structure, and there are but two
  of them on each side. The molars are of a pattern common in the
  Multituberculata; the centre is hollowed, and the raised rim is beset by
  tubercles. Other Jurassic genera of Multituberculates are <i>Bolodon</i>,
  <i>Allodon</i>, and <i>Stereognathus</i>. All of these possess the same
  multituberculate molars.</p>

  <p>Of the Triconodonta the type-genus is <i>Triconodon</i>. This genus is
  better known than most Jurassic mammals, since both the upper and the
  lower dentition have been described. It appears to have possessed the
  typical Eutherian dentition of forty-four teeth, to which a fourth molar
  is added in some species. The great difference between the molars and
  premolars argues a complete tooth-change. The genus is American as well
  as European.</p>

  <p><i>Spalacotherium</i> has more molars, five or six.</p>

  <p><i>Phascolotherium bucklandi</i>, on the other hand, is a much older
  type in the form of its teeth. There are, however, not so many of them as
  in <i>Amphitherium</i>; <i>Phascolotherium</i> has but two premolars and
  five molars, making a total of forty-eight teeth. The teeth are of the
  triconodont form, the three cusps being in line, and the middle one the
  largest. <!-- Page 100 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page100"></a>{100}</span></p>

  <p><i>Amphilestes</i> has teeth of the same pattern but has more of them,
  the premolars and molars being respectively four and five. All these
  animals had the lower jaw inflected. Whether they are all Marsupials or
  not, it is clear that <i>Phascolotherium</i> and <i>Amphilestes</i>
  should be united and placed away from <i>Amphitherium</i> on account of
  the more primitive form of their teeth.</p>

  <p>We next come to the Trituberculata.</p>

  <p>Among the most celebrated of these remains are a few jaws discovered
  in the Stonesfield slates near Oxford, and examined by Buckland, Cuvier,
  and some of the most eminent naturalists of the beginning of the last
  century. These jaws have been lately submitted to a careful
  re-examination by Mr. Goodrich,<a name="NtA_47"
  href="#Nt_47"><sup>[47]</sup></a> who has increased our knowledge of the
  subject by exposing from the rocky matrix in which the jaws lie fresh
  details of their structure; it is probable therefore that now all that
  there is to be learnt from these specimens has been recorded.</p>

  <p><i>Amphitherium prevostii</i> was a creature about the size of a Rat.
  Its jaw was first brought to Dean Buckland about the year 1814, and
  described six years later. Buckland thought the jaw to be that of an
  Opossum, an opinion in which Cuvier concurred. The jaw, however, is
  marked by a groove running along its length, and this groove was regarded
  by de Blainville as evidence of the composition of the jaw out of more
  than one element, which would naturally lead to its being regarded as the
  jaw of a reptile.<a name="NtA_48" href="#Nt_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a> This
  species and another named after Sir Richard Owen have a dental formula
  which, like that of the Marsupials, is large as compared with that of the
  Placental mammals; it runs: I&nbsp;4, C&nbsp;1, Pm&nbsp;5, M&nbsp;6&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> 64
  teeth altogether. This is a larger number than we find in any existing
  Marsupial. But as in Marsupials, and in certain Insectivora also, the
  angle of the jaw is inflected. These teeth are of the tritubercular
  pattern with a "heel." They are in fact closely like those of the living
  <i>Myrmecobius</i>; but not, it should be remarked, unlike those of
  certain Insectivora.</p>

  <p><b>The Mammals of the Cretaceous Period.</b>&mdash;At one time there
  was a totally inexplicable gap between the Jurassic and the basal Eocene,
  a series of strata which occupy an enormous expanse of time in the
  history of the earth having appeared to <!-- Page 101 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page101"></a>{101}</span>be devoid of mammalian
  remains. This gap, however, has been filled up by the discovery of
  mammalian remains in the North American Laramic formation, which seems to
  be clearly of Cretaceous age. Furthermore, it is held by some that the
  Purbeck beds are more properly to be placed with the Cretaceous, which
  would then necessitate the consideration under the present heading of
  some of the types already dealt with; and if, as is suggested in the
  following section, the lowest so-called Eocene beds are really referable
  to the Cretaceous, there is no lack of mammalian remains in that period.
  And, moreover, it was in that case the Cretaceous period which witnessed
  the evolution of the existing orders of Placental mammals. Otherwise the
  mammalian remains of the Cretaceous agree with those of the Jurassic. We
  find remains of the Multituberculata in fragments of Plagiaulacidae and
  Polymastodontidae. <i>Ptilodus</i> is a genus which has two premolars;
  and <i>Meniscoessus</i> is another multituberculate from the same Laramic
  formation. The other detached fragments of mammals are thought by Osborn
  to represent both Placentals and Marsupials.</p>

  <p><b>The Mammals of the Tertiary Period.</b>&mdash;Unless the lowest
  beds of the earliest Tertiary period, the Eocene, such as the Torrejon of
  North America, should be in reality referred to the Cretaceous, there is
  no evidence that the modern groups of Mammalia existed before the present
  epoch of the earth's history. It is probable, however, that the Eutheria
  as a group were Mesozoic. The fossil jaws that have been considered in
  the last chapter may quite probably be primitive Eutherians, or even
  divisible, as believed by Professor Osborn, into Marsupials and
  Insectivores. In the Tertiary, however, apart from the question as to the
  nature of the Puerco and Torrejon formations, and as to certain South
  American strata whose fossil contents have been investigated by Professor
  Ameghino, we find the first traces of mammals definitely referable to
  existing orders, or to be distinctly compared with existing orders.
  Since, however, representatives of types which have obvious relationships
  to modern types appear in considerable profusion in the very earliest
  strata of the Eocene, it seems clear that much remains to be discovered
  in beds earlier than these. Confining ourselves, however, to facts and to
  comparisons which can be made on more than a few lower jaws and scattered
  teeth, which is practically all that we <!-- Page 102 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page102"></a>{102}</span>possess of earlier
  mammals, we must arrive at the general conclusion that two of the
  existing larger groups of the Eutherian, non-Marsupial, mammals were
  differentiated at quite the beginning of the Eocene, and were represented
  by forms from which it is possible to derive at least the existing
  Carnivora, Insectivora, Artiodactyla, and Perissodactyla. These were the
  Creodonta and the Ungulate Condylarthra. In addition to these we may
  enumerate as very early types the Lemuroidea, represented by such forms
  as <i>Indrodon</i> in the New World, and (though later) by
  <i>Necrolemur</i>, etc., in the Old World, and the Edentata, if we are to
  allow as their ancestors the Ganodonta.</p>

  <p>The early Eocene strata also contain representatives of at least one
  order, the Amblypoda, which increased subsequently, but has died out
  without descendants, unless we are to believe with some that the
  Elephants are to be derived from these Eocene "pachyderms." In later
  Eocene times the great majority of the existing orders, and even
  subdivisions of orders, are to be met with; and there are in addition
  such totally extinct orders as the Typotheria, Ancylopoda, and
  Tillodontia. Coupled with this gradual specialisation in the orders of
  Eutherian mammals, there is naturally a vast increase in the number of
  generic and family types. This culminates perhaps in the Miocene, from
  which time there has been a gradual decline in mammalian variety, so that
  it is justly said that we live now in an epoch which is impoverished of
  mammals. This gradual decay has persisted until to-day, as is witnessed
  by the extinction of the Rhytina and the Quagga, and the growing rarity
  of the White Rhinoceros and the American Bison.</p>

  <p>The early Eutherian stock consisted of small mammals with small heads
  and slender, long tails. The limbs were pentadactyle, ensheathed in claws
  or broader hoofs. The fore-limbs may have been partly prehensile. The
  teeth were forty-four, completely differentiated into incisors, canines,
  molars, and premolars; and there appears to have been a complete
  diphyodontism. The canines were not greatly enlarged, and no diastema
  separated any of the teeth. The molars were bunodont or of a more cutting
  pattern, with some five or six tubercles. These animals were, moreover,
  very small-brained. This early stock is represented by Creodont and
  Condylarthrous animals, the exact boundaries between which are hardly
  marked in the <!-- Page 103 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page103"></a>{103}</span>very early types. Professor Osborn has
  argued that from this early Eutherian stock there were two waves of
  progress, or, as he expresses it, "two great centres of functional
  radiation."<a name="NtA_49" href="#Nt_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The first was largely ineffective, the second has produced all the
  Eutherian orders of to-day. These two divisions are termed by him
  "Mesoplacentalia" and "Cenoplacentalia." The first division embraces the
  Amblypoda and their descendants the Coryphodonts and Dinocerata, many of
  the Condylarthra, the bulk of the Creodonts and the Tillodonts. These
  creatures persisted for a time, but died out in the Miocene. They were
  mainly distinguished by the smallness of their brain; the great
  specialisation of structure which they exhibit having left that organ
  unaffected, and therefore tending in the long run to render them unable
  to cope with changes in the inorganic and organic world. The successful
  division of the primitive Eutheria comprises the groups which exist at
  the present day, and is not connected directly with those small-brained
  Mesoplacentals; it has apparently originated, however, from the least
  specialised of their ancestors. Professor Osborn thinks, moreover, that
  the Lemurs and the Insectivores are persistent descendants of the earlier
  wave of Eutherian life. It appears in fact as if Nature had created the
  existing Ungulate, Unguiculate, and other types on a defective plan, and,
  instead of mending them to suit more modern requirements, had evolved an
  entirely new set of similarly-organised types from some of the more
  ancient and plastic forms remaining over. The Marsupials may be the only
  group of the early wave remaining, and they have been able to hold their
  own for the geological reason that Australia was early cut off from
  communication with the rest of the world. That they are disappearing
  seems to be shown by their gradual diminution as we pass from Australia
  towards the continent of Asia, through the islands of the Malay
  Archipelago. Competition has here decimated them, as it may do in the
  remote future in Australia.</p>

  <p>It is often said, but with some looseness of statement, that ancient
  quadrupeds are huger than their modern representatives. This statement is
  partly true in fact, but largely wrong in implication. For it suggests
  that&mdash;and the suggestion is often expressed in books that are not
  authoritative&mdash;huge animals <!-- Page 104 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page104"></a>{104}</span>have left a dwarfish
  offspring; that there were giants of old, and that there is a puny race
  to-day. As a matter of fact, the study of the gradual evolution of the
  early Tertiary Mammalia into their descendants of later times shows very
  plainly the truth of this interesting generalisation: That the primitive
  types were all small creatures, and that in those instances where we can
  trace a pedigree, there was a gradual increase in size up to a point
  where greater increase led to extinction. We point out later on a number
  of facts illustrating this matter in detail. It has been ascertained, for
  instance, that the pedigree of the Horses, the Camels, the Rhinoceroses,
  and many other groups, commences with small forms and culminates in large
  ones. It may be urged that such animals as the Tapir are to-day smallish
  forms, and that related to them in the past were the gigantic
  Titanotheres; but in this and similar cases it will be found that the
  extinct giants were not in the direct line of pedigree, but represented
  side-branches which waxed huge on their own account and then
  disappeared.</p>

<h6>THE EXISTING ORDERS OF MAMMALS</h6>

<h5><span class="sc"><i>Prototheria</i></span>&mdash;<span class="sc"><i>Monotremata</i></span></h5>

  <p>Apart from those creatures whose fragmentary remains have been
  considered in the last chapter, and which belong to the earliest of
  mammaliferous strata, the remains of Mammalia are all referable to
  existing orders. In the pages which follow we shall therefore deal with
  the actual representatives of living families side by side with their
  extinct relatives. The existing orders of Mammalia, together with those
  of their fossil allies, can be plainly divided into two great
  subdivisions, or, as we shall term them, sub-classes; the Mammalia as a
  whole being termed a class of the Vertebrata comparable with the class
  Reptilia, etc. It has been usual, owing to the initiative of Professor
  Huxley, to divide the Mammalia into three divisions of primary
  importance. We shall adduce reasons later for not accepting this mode of
  division, but that which allows of only two primary divisions. These two
  divisions are (1) Prototheria and (2) Eutheria. Whether the
  Multituberculata, Trituberculata, and Triconodonta, considered in the
  last chapter, are really to be distributed among these two sub-classes is
  a matter upon which it is possible to form an opinion, but not to
  dogmatise. The Prototheria stand at the base of the mammalian series, and
  present many likenesses to the Sauropsida; the Eutheria are the animals
  which are most fully differentiated as mammals. We shall commence
  with</p>

<h5><span class="sc"><i>Sub-Class I.</i></span>&mdash;<i>PROTOTHERIA.</i></h5>

  <p>To this group belongs the order Monotremata, and possibly also the
  so-called Allotheria or Multituberculata. As, however, <!-- Page 106
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page106"></a>{106}</span>the latter are
  only known from very fragmentary remains, which are not sufficient to
  determine the systematic position of the animals of which they are
  fragments, I have not thought it worth while to attempt a serious
  definition of the order Multituberculata. I have introduced a short
  account of the principal facts which are known concerning the creatures
  grouped together under this name into the historical sketch of the
  progress of mammalian life in Chapter IV. As to the Monotremata, there is
  no question that they are entitled to rank in a group equivalent to that
  including all other mammals of which we have sufficient knowledge to
  construct a classificatory scheme. There have been, indeed, naturalists,
  such as Meckel, who would altogether deny the mammalian rank of these
  creatures.</p>

  <p>The Monotremata or Ornithodelphia may be thus defined<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>Mammalia with no teats, but with a temporary pouch in which the young
  are hatched, or to which they are transferred after hatching, and into
  which open the ducts of the mammary glands. An anterior abdominal vein,
  or at least the membrane supporting it, persists throughout the abdominal
  cavity. Heart with an incomplete and largely fleshy right
  auriculo-ventricular valve. Brain without a corpus callosum. Shoulder
  girdle with a large coracoid reaching the sternum; clavicles and an
  interclavicle present. There are "marsupial" or epipubic bones attached
  to the pelvis. Vertebrae with no epiphyses for the most part. Ribs with
  only capitulum and no tuberculum. Mammary glands of the sudoriparous and
  not the sebaceous type of epidermic gland.<a name="NtA_50"
  href="#Nt_50"><sup>[50]</sup></a> Oviparous, with a large-yolked and
  meroblastic ovum, enclosed within a follicle of two rows of cells.</p>

  <p>To call these animals Mammalia is of course an abuse of the meaning of
  that word in one sense, but it is not in another; since the pouch of
  these Monotremes is, as has been explained elsewhere (p. <a
  href="#page16">16</a>), the real equivalent of a teat, and not of the
  pouch of the Marsupials.</p>

  <p>The most salient characteristic of this group of mammals in the
  estimation of their position in the vertebrate series is not so much the
  fact that they are oviparous as that the eggs are large-yolked, and
  develop therefore, so far as regards their early stages, after the
  fashion of the egg of a reptile. The laying <!-- Page 107 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page107"></a>{107}</span>of eggs, or at least
  ovoviviparity, would follow from the structure of the egg, since the
  abundance of yolk would do away with the necessity for a placenta. That
  the eggs had this Saurian characteristic was first definitely made known
  by Professor Poulton<a name="NtA_51" href="#Nt_51"><sup>[51]</sup></a>
  for <i>Ornithorhynchus</i>, and his results were confirmed later for
  <i>Echidna</i>.<a name="NtA_52" href="#Nt_52"><sup>[52]</sup></a> The
  structure of the eggs has, however, already been dealt with on p. <a
  href="#page72">72</a>. The fact that these animals lay eggs appears to
  have been known for a very long time, though rediscovered so lately as
  1884 by Mr. Caldwell.<a name="NtA_53" href="#Nt_53"><sup>[53]</sup></a>
  In connexion with the structure of the ova, the ovaries themselves and
  the oviducts are built upon the Sauropsidan plan. In the male the testes
  retain the primitive abdominal position. The fact that the urinary and
  genital products escape by means of their ducts into a chamber which also
  receives the end of the alimentary tract is not a distinctive feature of
  this group, inasmuch as it is seen in the Marsupials, and also in certain
  low Eutheria, such as the Beaver and other Rodents, and a few
  Insectivores. As to external features, the Monotremata show certain
  archaic characters. The unspecialised arrangement of the mammary glands
  has already been described. These animals are plantigrade, if the term
  may be used also to describe the aquatic <i>Ornithorhynchus</i>. The ears
  are absolutely destitute of a conch. The remarkable spur upon the
  hind-legs furnished with a gland, which is more marked in the male, and
  indeed disappears in the female of <i>Ornithorhynchus</i>, is a structure
  which argues the specialised condition of these two modern
  representatives of what must have been a large order in the past.</p>

  <p>The skeleton shows numerous ancient characteristics. In the skull
  there is no demarcation of the orbit from the temporal fossa, a feature
  widely found in archaic mammals. The tympanic remains as a slender ring,
  there being no auditory bulla formed either from this or from any other
  bone. The malleus and incus are large, and thus reminiscent of the
  quadrate and articular bone of reptiles. In the lower jaw the absence of
  a marked coronoid process, and the absence of a firm ossification at the
  meeting of the two rami, may be a primitive state of affairs. It must be
  remembered, however, that the Cetacea show the same characters, though it
  is possible that they too are developed from a low mammalian stock. In
  the vertebral column we find the typical mammalian seven cervicals; but
  those characteristically mammalian structures the epiphyses are totally
  absent in <i>Echidna</i>, and only to be seen in the tail-region in
  <i>Ornithorhynchus</i>. In having only the capitular head to the ribs,
  these mammals are evidently far removed from all other mammals, and are
  even more reptilian than the Theromorphous reptiles. The large clavicles
  and the interclavicle (Fig. 52, <!-- Page 109 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page109"></a>{109}</span>p. 109) are characteristic of the group,
  and the latter bone is peculiar to the Monotremata among mammals. So,
  too, is the large coracoid. In the scapula there is a spine which
  coincides with the anterior border of that bone. The arrangement of the
  muscles in this region proves conclusively that this projection is the
  homologue of the spine and the acromion of other mammals. Here, again, we
  have a point of likeness to the Cetacea.<a name="NtA_54"

  <p>Considering the numerous very archaic features which the general
  structure of this group displays, it is surprising to find how typically
  mammalian they are in certain other peculiarities. The mammalian
  diaphragm, one of the distinguishing features of the class, is perfectly
  normal in the Monotremata. The alimentary canal shows no great
  divergences from the normal structure. The stomach is almost globular,
  with a projecting pyloric region in <i>Ornithorhynchus</i>; the intestine
  is divided into a "small" and "large" intestine by a slender caecum. The
  liver has the subdivisions that this organ usually shows in the Mammalia.
  However, the presence of the ventral mesentery and of the abdominal vein
  in <i>Echidna</i> and <i>Ornithorhynchus</i> has already been mentioned
  as a distinctive character. The peculiar and apparently partly primitive
  valve of the right ventricle has been described above (see p. <a
  href="#page66">66</a>). The brain is in most respects mammalian in its
  characters, but naturally shows some important differences. Dr. Elliot
  Smith, who has most recently studied this question,<a name="NtA_55"
  href="#Nt_55"><sup>[55]</sup></a> is of opinion that the size of the
  cerebral hemispheres is not at all reptilian; indeed, it "greatly exceeds
  that of <!-- Page 110 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page110"></a>{110}</span>many other mammals." In <i>Echidna</i>,
  too, but not in <i>Ornithorhynchus</i>, the hemispheres are well
  convoluted, though the arrangement of these convolutions cannot be
  brought into line with what is known concerning the convolutions upon the
  hemispheres of other mammals. It had been stated that in these animals,
  at least in <i>Echidna</i>, there were only two optic lobes, as in lower
  vertebrates, instead of the mammalian four. The late Sir W. H. Flower set
  this matter at rest,<a name="NtA_56" href="#Nt_56"><sup>[56]</sup></a>
  and showed that <i>Echidna</i> was in this respect typically mammalian.
  The absence of the corpus callosum is one of the principal features
  separating the Monotremes from other mammals.</p>

  <p>The Monotremata are represented to-day by two types,
  <i>Ornithorhynchus</i> and <i>Echidna</i>, which are no doubt worthy of
  being placed in separate families. Fossil remains of the group (apart
  from the problematical Multituberculata) are only known from Pleistocene
  times in Australia, and consist of the bones of a large species of
  <i>Echidna</i>, and some fragments of <i>Ornithorhynchus</i>, indicating
  a smaller animal than the living Platypus.</p>

dorsal view. (Nat. size.) (From
Parker and Haswell's <i>Zoology</i>.)</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Echidnidae.</b>&mdash;This family contains two genera, of
  which <i>Echidna</i> is the older and much the better known. The skin is
  abundantly covered with spines, with which are mingled hairs. The snout
  is tapering, the tail rudimentary, and the fingers and toes five in
  number. The spur and gland upon the calcaneum are smaller than in
  <i>Ornithorhynchus</i>. The claws are very strong, serving to tear open
  the ants' nests, upon the inhabitants of which the Echidna feeds, licking
  them up with a long extensile tongue like that of <i>Myrmecophaga</i>. In
  relation to this habit the salivary glands are enormously developed, and
  indeed the animal has been confounded with <i>Myrmecophaga</i>,<a
  name="NtA_57" href="#Nt_57"><sup>[57]</sup></a> as the vernacular name
  "Australian Anteater" exemplifies. <!-- Page 111 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page111"></a>{111}</span></p>

  <p>In the skull the Echidna differs from <i>Ornithorhynchus</i> in the
  greater extension backwards of the palatines, and the larger size of the
  pterygoids. The extent and relations of these bones to each other is not
  at all unlike that which obtains in many Whales. The premaxillae show
  traces of the same divergence followed by convergence of their ends that
  is seen in the Platypus. There are only sixteen pairs of ribs, and either
  three or four lumbar vertebrae. <i>Echidna</i> has no trace of teeth, and
  there are no horny pads which take their place; the mouth is as
  edentulous as in the true American Anteaters. The brain (Fig. 53) is
  marked by sulci, contrary to what we find in <i>Ornithorhynchus</i>. The
  genus has been divided into three species, but it is doubtful whether
  more than one can be allowed, which ranges from Australia through the
  Papuan region. While there is but one species of true <i>Echidna</i>, a
  New Guinea species must clearly be referred to a distinct genus
  <i>Proechidna</i>.<a name="NtA_58" href="#Nt_58"><sup>[58]</sup></a> This
  animal is to be distinguished by the fact that there are usually but
  three toes on each foot. But there are copious rudiments of the other
  phalanges, upon which claws are sometimes developed. The beak is curved
  downwards, and the back is rather arched; the whole animal has the most
  singular likeness to an Elephant! The ribs are increased by one pair, and
  there are four lumbar vertebrae. The one species is named <i>P.
  bruijnii</i>. The Hon. W. Rothschild<a name="NtA_59"
  href="#Nt_59"><sup>[59]</sup></a> distinguishes a form <i>P.
  nigroaculeata</i>, which is allowed by Mr. Lydekker.</p>

<p><!-- Page 112 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page112"></a>{112}</span></p>

  <p>The Echidna feeds like anteaters, by thrusting its tongue into an
  ant-hill, and waiting until it is covered with indignant and marauding
  ants, which are then swallowed. But this animal also devours worms and
  insects, which are extracted from their hiding-places by the tongue. It
  is mainly nocturnal, and prefers the seclusion of the densest scrubs of
  the bush, or rocky spots where it is free from intrusion. Dr. Semon did
  not find that the spur of this animal was used at all in self-defence;
  but he thinks that possibly the weapon may be used, in the breeding
  season only, in the combats of the males for the females, when perhaps,
  as has been shown to be the case in <i>Ornithorhynchus</i>, the gland
  attached to it produces a poisonous secretion.</p>

  <p>The egg, as it appears, is transferred to the pouch by the mouth of
  the mother; the shell is broken by the emerging young one, which has an
  egg-breaking tubercle on its snout for this purpose; the mother removes
  the shell. When the young has attained a certain size, the mother removes
  it from the pouch, but takes it in from time to time to suckle it. When
  on her nightly rambles the young one is left in a burrow dug for the
  purpose. Dr. Semon was able, from his own observations, to substantiate
  this act of intelligence on the part of the Echidna. It is well known
  that the temperature of the Monotremes is less than that of higher
  mammals; in addition to this fact Dr. Semon found that the range of
  variation of temperature in the Echidna was as much as 13 degrees or
  more. It is thus intermediate between the "poikilothermal" reptiles and
  the "homoeothermal" mammals.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Ornithorhynchidae.</b>&mdash;There is no need to attempt to
  define this family, since it contains but one genus
  <i>Ornithorhynchus</i>, with but one species, <i>O. anatinus</i>. The
  general aspect of the animal is well known. It is covered with dense fur
  of a blackish brown colour; the limbs are short and five-toed, the toes
  being webbed. The tail is longish and broad, being flattened from above
  downwards. The webbing on the anterior toes considerably outdistances the
  tips of the claws, as in the Seals. But this is not the case with the
  hind-feet. The "beak," which is broad and flat, and does actually suggest
  that of a duck, is not covered with horn, as is often stated, but with a
  fine, soft, sensitive, naked skin, which abounds in sense-organs of a
  tactile nature. As to characters derived from the skeleton,
  <i>Ornithorhynchus</i> has <!-- Page 113 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page113"></a>{113}</span>seventeen pairs of ribs and only two
  lumbar vertebrae. The skull is expanded in front, and the bill is
  supported by two, at first diverging, and then converging, premaxillae.
  Between them is the famous "dumb-bell shaped bone," which is believed to
  be the representative of the reptilian prevomer. The pterygoids are
  smaller than in <i>Echidna</i>, and the hard palate does not extend so
  far back as in that genus. The brain of this genus is smooth.</p>

  <p>The discovery of the real teeth of <i>Ornithorhynchus</i> only dates
  from the year 1888, when they were found by Professor Poulton<a
  name="NtA_60" href="#Nt_60"><sup>[60]</sup></a> in an embryo. Later Mr.
  Thomas found<a name="NtA_61" href="#Nt_61"><sup>[61]</sup></a> that the
  teeth persist for a considerable portion of the animal's life, and are
  only shed, like milk teeth, "after being worn down by friction with food
  and sand." We have already (p. <a href="#page98">98</a>) called attention
  to the general similarity of these teeth to those of certain of the
  earliest Mammalia and of mammal-like reptiles. The teeth are all molars,
  and they are either eight or ten in number. They are replaced by the
  horny plates of the adult animal; but the mode of replacement is curious.
  The plates are developed from the epithelium of the mouth, but round and
  under the true teeth; the epithelium of the mouth grows gradually under
  the calcified teeth, a method of growth which has possibly something to
  do with the shedding of the latter. The hollows and <!-- Page 114
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page114"></a>{114}</span>grooves in the
  plates are the remains of the original alveoli of the teeth.</p>

  <p>The Duck-billed Platypus is, as every one knows, an aquatic animal. It
  is not found all over Australia, but is limited to the southern and
  eastern parts of that continent, and to Tasmania. The animal excavates a
  burrow for itself in the bank of the slow streams which it frequents. The
  burrow has one opening below the water and one above; and it is of some
  length, twenty to fifty feet. The Platypus feeds upon animal food,
  chiefly "grubs, worms, snails, and, most of all, mussels." These it stows
  away when captured into its capacious cheek-pouches. The food is then
  chewed and swallowed above the surface as the animal drifts slowly along.
  Dr. Semon, from whose work, <i>In the Australian Bush</i>, this account
  of the animal's habits is quoted, thinks that in the nature of the food
  of the creature the explanation of the loss of the teeth is to be found.
  He is of opinion that for cracking the hard shells of the mollusc
  <i>Corbicula nepeanensis</i>, upon which <i>Ornithorhynchus</i> mainly
  feeds, the horny plates are preferable to brittle teeth.
  <i>Ornithorhynchus</i> is apparently not eaten by the natives by reason
  of its ancient and fish-like smell. Besides, it is hard to catch on
  account of its diving capacities, which are aided by an acute sense of
  sight and of hearing. When the Duck-bill was first brought to this
  country it was believed to be a deliberate fraud, analogous to the
  mermaids produced by neatly stitching together the forepart of a monkey
  and the tail of a salmon.</p>

<h6>INTRODUCTION TO THE SUB-CLASS EUTHERIA</h6>

<h5><span class="sc"><i>Sub-Class II.</i></span>&mdash;<i>EUTHERIA</i></h5>

  <p><b>Definition.</b>&mdash;Mammalia with teats. Mammary glands of
  sebaceous type. Heart with entirely membranous and complete right
  auriculo-ventricular valve. Brain generally with a corpus callosum.
  Coracoid much reduced and not reaching sternum. No interclavicle.
  Vertebrae with epiphyses. Ribs double-headed. Viviparous, with a small
  ovum.</p>

  <p>In this group are included not only the Eutheria in the sense of
  Huxley, but also his Metatheria. Though the Metatheria, or Marsupials as
  we shall term them, undoubtedly form a most distinct order of mammals,
  perhaps even a trifle more distinct than most others, their differences
  from the remaining tribes are not by any means so great as those which
  separate <i>Ornithorhynchus</i> and <i>Echidna</i> from all other
  mammals. In his well-known memoir upon the arrangement of the Mammalia,<a
  name="NtA_62" href="#Nt_62"><sup>[62]</sup></a> Professor Huxley
  enumerated eleven characters as distinguishing the Metatheria either from
  the Prototheria or from the Eutheria. Of these only three were characters
  in which they approach the lower mammals. According to his showing,
  therefore, the preponderance of marsupial features are Eutherian. The
  three characters of Prototherian type are (1) the presence of epipubes;
  (2) the small corpus callosum; (3) the absence of an allantoic
  placenta.</p>

  <p>The last of these can be dismissed, in consequence of the recent
  discovery of an allantoic placenta in <i>Perameles</i>. The first
  character is apparently a valid distinction between the Marsupials <!--
  Page 117 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page117"></a>{117}</span>and
  their mammalian relatives higher in the series; but it is not a character
  that should have been made use of by Huxley, since he believed in the
  existence of a corresponding element in the Dog. As to the corpus
  callosum (Fig. 50, p. <a href="#page77">77</a>) being small, that seems
  to be not more than a slight difference of degree.<a name="NtA_63"
  href="#Nt_63"><sup>[63]</sup></a> A number of other characters of
  secondary importance were added by Huxley to the weight of evidence which
  led him to form a group Metatheria for the Marsupials. Some of these,
  however, are now known to be not evidence in that direction. For instance
  he observed that no Marsupial had more than a single successional tooth.
  It seems at the present moment to be fairly clear that Marsupials have a
  milk dentition like other Eutherians, but that only one of these teeth,
  the fourth premolar, comes to functional maturity. That it is really one
  of a complete milk series is evidenced by the fact that this tooth is
  differentiated contemporaneously with another series formerly held to
  belong to the so-called prelacteal dentition.<a name="NtA_64"
  href="#Nt_64"><sup>[64]</sup></a> There still remains, of course, the
  actual fact that the milk dentition is not for the most part functional,
  but its significance breaks down with these fresh discoveries. Of this
  Professor Osborn has remarked: "The discovery of the complete double
  series seems to have removed the last straw from the theory of the
  marsupial ancestry of the Placentals." But Huxley did not lay much stress
  upon this matter of the teeth, since he observed that similar
  suppressions of the milk dentition were to be found in many other mammals
  admittedly Eutherian.</p>

  <p>Huxley regarded the peculiarities in the reproductive organs <!-- Page
  118 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page118"></a>{118}</span>of the
  Marsupials as "singularly specialised characters," in no way intermediate
  in character. This view applies also to the pouch, which, as already
  stated, distinguishes the adults of that group. But the impossibility of
  using this last character as one of any importance has been shown by the
  discovery of rudiments of it in embryos of undoubtedly Eutherian mammals
  (see p. <a href="#page18">18</a>).</p>

  <p>Less stress is laid now upon the existence of four molars in the
  Marsupials as dividing them from the higher mammals than was formerly the
  case. The total dentition of the group is on the whole composed of more
  numerous individual teeth than in the typical Eutheria; but we have
  exceptions like the Whales, the Armadillo <i>Priodontes</i>, and the
  Manatee; or better, because free from the suspicion of secondary
  multiplication, <i>Otocyon</i> and occasionally (according to Mr. Thomas)
  <i>Centetes</i>. In the last two there are at least sometimes four
  molars.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, a few archaic characters of some importance crop up
  here and there among the Marsupials, which are sometimes held to point to
  a primitive ancestry. It has been remarked that in Marsupials it is the
  fourth toe which is dominant in size, whereas in Ungulates it is the
  third. An attempt has been made to explain this on the view (reasonable
  enough in itself) of a tree-living ancestry for the group. A greater
  development of the fourth toe is, however, by no means a necessary
  character of arboreal creatures; the Primates themselves are an
  exception. Nor is this prevalence universal among the Marsupials; <!--
  Page 119 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page119"></a>{119}</span>in
  <i>Myrmecobius</i> (alone) is the third toe the longest; and no great
  difference can be detected between the third and fourth toes in the case
  of the genera <i>Phascologale</i>, <i>Didelphys</i>, and some others.
  Professor Leche compares the predominance of the fourth toe with the
  hyperphalangeal condition in the fourth toe of the embryo Crocodile, and
  considers it an archaic feature, not surpassed by the ancient
  characteristics of the Monotremata. Again it has been pointed out that in
  <i>Phascologale</i> and <i>Perameles</i>, the epistropheus (axis
  vertebra) has a separate rib as in <i>Ornithorhynchus</i>. In the third
  place, the likeness of the teeth of <i>Myrmecobius</i> to those of
  <i>Ornithorhynchus</i> is an argument in the same direction, which is
  furthermore supported by the great age (Mesozoic) of the Metatherian
  group, if we are right in regarding those extinct creatures as
  Marsupials.</p>

  <p>We may now mention certain facts which are not so generally used. The
  partly primitive structure of the right auriculo-ventricular valve in the
  Monotremata has no counterpart in any Marsupial which has been dissected;
  but there are traces in the latter of the characteristic "ventral
  mesentery" of <i>Ornithorhynchus</i> and <i>Echidna</i>.<a name="NtA_65"
  href="#Nt_65"><sup>[65]</sup></a> Mr. Caldwell's interesting observation
  upon the segmenting egg of the Marsupial, the incompleteness of the first
  segmentation furrow (reminding us of the meroblastic ovum of the
  Monotreme), may possibly not turn out to be so exclusively Marsupial a
  feature as has been thought.</p>

  <p>The balance of evidence thus points to the nearer relationship of the
  Marsupials to the Eutherian mammals; and their great specialisation
  combined with certain evidences of degeneration (disappearance in part of
  the milk dentition), and their age, point to the fact that they are, at
  any rate, the descendants of an early form of Eutherian. But they must
  have separated from the Eutherian stock after it had acquired a definite
  diphyodonty and the allantoic placenta, the two principal features of the
  Eutherian as opposed to the Prototherian mammals.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless it seems probable that the Marsupial tribe is derived
  from some of the earliest Eutherians. And on this view may be explained
  the retention of Prototherian characters.</p>

  <p>The remaining Eutheria are obviously all to be referred to one great
  division with the possible exception of the Whales, whose affinities form
  one of the principal difficulties to the student <!-- Page 120 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page120"></a>{120}</span>of this group. A short
  résumé of what is at present thought of the systematic position of this
  anomalous order is appropriate here. Albrecht went so far as to regard
  the Cetacea as the nearest group of animals to the hypothetical
  Promammalia.<a name="NtA_66" href="#Nt_66"><sup>[66]</sup></a> But
  discounting his arguments by the removal of such of them as relate to
  structure plainly altered by the singular mode of life of these
  creatures, there is really a great deal to be said in favour of his
  view.</p>

  <p>The chief facts which argue a primitive position among mammals for the
  Cetacea are perhaps: (1) the slight union of the rami of the lower jaw;
  (2) the occasionally rather marked traces of the double constitution of
  the sternum; (3) the long and simple lungs; (4) the retention of the
  testes within the body-cavity; (5) the occasional presence (in
  <i>Balaenoptera</i>) of a separate supra-angular bone. These points,
  however, are but few, and are not of such great weight as those which
  ought to be present to establish a claim to separate treatment for the
  Cetacea as opposed to the Eutheria. If this group of mammals can be
  tacked on anywhere, it appears to us that the nearest relatives are not,
  as is sometimes put forward, the Ungulata or the Carnivora, but the
  Edentata. There are quite a number of rather striking features in which a
  likeness is shown between these apparently diverse orders of mammals. The
  chief ones are these: (1) the existence of traces of a hard exoskeleton,
  of which vestiges remain in the Porpoise; (2) the double articulation of
  the rib of the Balaenopterids to the sternum, with which compare the
  conditions obtaining in the Great Anteater; (3) the concrescence of some
  of the cervical vertebrae; (4) the share which the pterygoids may take in
  the formation of the hard palate; (5) the fact that in the Porpoise, at
  any rate, as in many Edentates, the vena cava, instead of increasing in
  size as it approaches the liver, diminishes.</p>

  <p>Another group which is perfectly isolated is that of the Sirenia. The
  alliance advocated by some with the Cetacea, and quite recently renewed
  by Professor Haeckel, is contradicted by so many important features that
  it seems necessary to abandon it. The recent discovery of a fossil
  Sirenian jaw by Dr. Lydekker with teeth highly suggestive of those of
  Artiodactyla, may prove a clue. A third group which is so isolated as to
  have been placed in a <!-- Page 121 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page121"></a>{121}</span>primary division, proposed to be called
  Paratheria, is that of the Edentates. Probably the group so called should
  really be divided into the Edentata and the Effodientia, the latter
  containing the Old World forms. Whether or not it be ultimately shown
  that the Ganodonta are ancestral Edentates (<i>sensu strictiori</i>), the
  connexion of the group with others is not at present plain. The same is
  the case with the extensive order of Rodents. It is true that the extinct
  order of the Tillodontia shows certain Rodent-like characters on the one
  hand, and likenesses to Ungulates on the other. Certain likenesses shown
  by such apparently diverse animals as the Rabbit and the Elephant used to
  be insisted upon by Professor Huxley. For the present, however, the
  Rodents must remain as an isolated group with only very dubious
  affinities to others. The remaining groups of existing mammals are easier
  to connect. At first the differences between a Cat and a Horse seem to be
  quite as wide as those which separate any two of the higher Eutherian
  orders. But it seems to become clearer and clearer, as palaeontological
  investigation proceeds, that the bulk of the Ungulate and the
  Carnivorous, Insectivorous, and perhaps Lemuroid stocks converge into the
  early Eocene Creodonta. From the Lemuroid branch the higher Primates can
  be derived. The only "Ungulates" which cannot be fitted in with some
  reasonable probability is the group of the Proboscidea. But of the early
  forms of this division we have at present no knowledge.</p>

<h6>EUTHERIA&mdash;MARSUPIALIA</h6>

<h5><b>Order I. MARSUPIALIA<a name="NtA_67" href="#Nt_67"><sup>[67]</sup></a></b></h5>

  <p>The Marsupials may be thus defined<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span>Terrestrial, arboreal, or burrowing (rarely
  aquatic) mammals, with furry integuments; palate generally somewhat
  imperfectly ossified; jugal bone reaching as far as the glenoid cavity;
  angle of lower jaw nearly always inflected. The clavicle is developed.
  Arising from the pubes are well developed and ossified epipubic bones.
  Fourth toe usually the most pronounced. Teeth often exceed the typical
  Eutherian number of forty-four; molars generally four on each side of
  each jaw. As a rule but one tooth of the milk set is functional, which is
  (according to many) the fourth premolar. Teats lying within a pouch, in
  which the young are placed. Young born in an imperfect condition, and
  showing certain larval characters. There is a shallow cloaca. The testes
  are extra-abdominal, but hang in front of the penis. In the brain the
  cerebellum is completely exposed; the hemispheres are furrowed, but the
  corpus callosum is rudimentary. An allantoic placenta is rarely
  present.</p>

  <p>Structurally the Marsupials are somewhat intermediate between the
  Prototheria and the more typical Eutheria, with a greater resemblance to
  the latter.</p>

(After Vogt and Specht.)</p>

  <p>The name Marsupial indicates what is perhaps the most salient
  character of this order. The pouch in which the young are carried is
  almost universally present. It is less developed <!-- Page 123 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page123"></a>{123}</span>on the whole in the
  Polyprotodont forms, such as the Thylacine, Dasyures, etc., but is found
  in so many of them that the two divisions of the Marsupials, the
  Diprotodonts and the Polyprotodonts, cannot be raised to distinct orders
  on this and other grounds. The marsupial pouch of the Marsupials must
  not, as has been already pointed out, be confounded with the pouch of the
  Monotreme mammals. Distinct teats are found in the marsupium of the
  Marsupials, while there are none in the mammary pouch of the Monotreme,
  the pouch itself indeed representing an undifferentiated teat, of which
  the walls have not closed up. The pouch opens forward in the Kangaroos,
  and backwards in the Phalangers and in the Polyprotodonts. Its walls are
  supported by a pair of bones diverging from each other in a <img
  src="images/v.png" class="middle" style="height:2ex;" alt="V" />-shaped
  manner; these are cartilaginous and vestigial in the Thylacine. They <!--
  Page 124 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page124"></a>{124}</span>are
  the precise equivalents of similar bones in the Monotremata. It has been
  held, but apparently erroneously, that these bones are mere ossifications
  in the tendons of the external oblique muscle of the abdomen, or of the
  pyramidalis of the same region; and vestiges have been asserted to exist
  in the Dog. Such bonelets are undoubtedly present in the Dog; but it
  seems clear from their development in Marsupials, as structures actually
  continuous with the median unossified portion of the symphysis pubis,
  that the "marsupial bones" belong to that part of the skeleton, and that
  they correspond with the epipubis of certain amphibians and reptiles. The
  pouch, it may be remarked, exists in a rudimentary form in the males of
  many Marsupials.</p>

of Kangaroo attached to
the teat. (Nat. size.)
(From Parker and Haswell's
<i>Zoology</i>.)</p>

  <p>The most salient feature in the life-history of the Marsupials is the
  imperfect condition in which the young are born. The egg is no longer
  laid, as in the Monotremes; but curiously enough the ovum, which has the
  small size of that of the Eutheria, divides incompletely at the first
  division (as Mr. Caldwell has shown), and this developmental feature may
  perhaps be looked upon as a reminiscence of a former large-yolked
  condition. The young when born are small and nude; the newly born young
  of a large Kangaroo is perhaps as large as the little finger. The young
  are transferred by the lips of the mother to the pouch, where they are
  placed upon a teat. It is an interesting fact that they are not merely
  imperfect foetuses, but that they are actual larvae. They possess in fact
  at any rate one larval organ in the shape of <!-- Page 125 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page125"></a>{125}</span>a special sucking
  mouth. This sucking mouth is an extra-uterine production, and is of
  course an adaptation to the particular needs of the young, just as are
  other larval organs, such as the chin-suckers of the tadpole, or the
  regular ciliated bands of the larvae of various marine invertebrate
  organisms.</p>

  <p>There are a number of other features which distinguish the Marsupials
  from other mammals.</p>

  <p>The cloaca of the Marsupials is somewhat reduced, but is still
  recognisable. Its margins in <i>Tarsipes</i> are even raised into a wall,
  which projects from the body.</p>

  <p>The tooth series of the Marsupials was once held to consist of one
  dentition only, with the exception of the last premolar, which has a
  forerunner. The interpretation of the teeth of Marsupials are various.
  Perhaps most authorities regard the teeth as being of the milk dentition,
  with the exception of course of the single tooth that has an obvious
  forerunner. But there are some who hold that the teeth are of the
  permanent dentition. In any case it is proved that a set of rudimentary
  teeth are developed before those which persist. Those who believe in the
  persisting milk dentition describe these as prelacteal. Another matter of
  importance about the teeth of this order of mammals is that their numbers
  are sometimes in excess of the typical Eutherian 44. This, however, holds
  good of the Polyprotodonts only.</p>

  <p>It was for a long time held that the Marsupials differed from all
  other mammals in having no allantoic placenta. But quite recently this
  supposed difference has been proved to be not universal by the discovery
  in <i>Perameles</i> of a true allantoic placenta. The Marsupials have
  been sometimes called the Didelphia. This is on account of the fact that
  the uterus and the vagina are double. Very frequently the two uteri fuse
  above, and from the point of junction an unpaired descending passage is
  formed (see Fig. 48 on p. <a href="#page74">74</a>).</p>

  <p>A character of the brain of Marsupials has been the subject of some
  controversy. Sir Richard Owen stated many years ago that they were to be
  distinguished from the higher mammals by the absence of the corpus
  callosum. Later still it was urged that a true corpus callosum, though a
  small one, was present; while, finally, Professor Symington<a
  name="NtA_68" href="#Nt_68"><sup>[68]</sup></a> seems to have shown that
  <!-- Page 126 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page126"></a>{126}</span>the original statement of Owen was
  correct, at least in part. It is at most feebly developed (see Fig. 58,
  p. <a href="#page118">118</a>).</p>

  <p>As to skeletal characters, the Marsupial skull has on the whole a
  tendency towards a permanent separation of bones usually firmly
  ankylosed. Thus the orbitosphenoids remain distinct from the presphenoid.
  The palate is largely fenestrated, a return as it were&mdash;says
  Professor Parker&mdash;to the Schizognathous palate of the bird. The
  mandible is inflected; this familiar character of the Marsupials goes
  back to the earliest representatives of the order in Mesozoic times (see
  p. <a href="#page96">96</a>); but it is not absolutely universal, being
  absent from the much weakened skull of <i>Tarsipes</i>. On the other
  hand, the inflection is nearly as great in certain Insectivores, in
  <i>Otocyon</i>, etc. The malar always extends back to form part of the
  glenoid cavity. The shoulder girdle has lost the large coracoid of
  Monotremes; this bone has the vestigial character that it possesses in
  other Eutheria. The clavicle is present except in the Peramelidae. A
  third trochanter upon the femur seems to be never present.</p>

  <p>The Marsupials cannot be regarded as an intermediate stage in the
  origin of the Eutheria for a number of reasons. In the first place, the
  nature of their teeth shows them to be degenerate animals; one set,
  whether we regard it as the milk or permanent dentition, has become
  vestigial. The recent discovery of a true allantoic placenta in
  <i>Perameles</i> removes one reason for regarding <!-- Page 127 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page127"></a>{127}</span>the Marsupials as
  primitive creatures. It implies on the whole that the Marsupials have
  sprung from a stock with an allantoic placenta. The alternative is to
  assume the independent development of an allantoic placenta in both
  groups of the Mammalia; unless indeed the genus <i>Perameles</i> is to be
  held to be the most primitive race of Marsupials living, a hypothesis
  which does not appear on the face of it likely. So long as it was
  believed that the mammary pouch of the Monotremes was the equivalent of
  the marsupium of the Marsupials, the persistence of this structure seemed
  to be a bond of union between the groups. But it is now known that the
  marsupium is a special organ confined to the Marsupials, an argument
  which is rather in favour of their being a lateral development of the
  mammalian stem. It is to be remarked also that the marsupium is feeblest
  in the Polyprotodonts, which may perhaps be looked upon as the most
  primitive of the Marsupials, owing to their more numerous teeth and other
  points to be referred to immediately.</p>

  <p>Not only are the Marsupials interesting from the point of view of
  their structure; their present and past distribution is of equal
  interest. During the Mesozoic epoch they occurred in Europe and North
  America; but not, so far as negative evidence means anything, in
  Australia, which is now their headquarters. In Europe Marsupials lingered
  on into the Tertiary period, when they finally became extinct. In
  America, of course, the group has persisted to the present day. Now it is
  important to notice that the two main subdivisions of the Marsupials, the
  Polyprotodontia and the Diprotodontia, exist to-day in both Australia and
  South America. These two divisions, it should be explained, differ
  principally in that one has numerous, the other rarely more than two,<a
  name="NtA_69" href="#Nt_69"><sup>[69]</sup></a> incisors in the lower
  jaw. It is perhaps the more widely distributed opinion that the
  Polyprotodontia are the more archaic group; this opinion rests upon one
  or two facts in addition to the absence of specialisation in the incisor
  teeth. Among the Polyprotodontia the total number of teeth is
  greater&mdash;a clearly primitive character; secondly, the general form
  of the body of these animals, with four subequal limbs and carnivorous or
  omnivorous diet, contrasts with the purely vegetarian and much
  specialised Kangaroos at any rate. Finally&mdash;and sufficient stress
  <!-- Page 128 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page128"></a>{128}</span>has perhaps not been laid upon this
  matter&mdash;the brain among the Polyprotodonts is less convoluted than
  among the genera of the other division. This statement is of course made
  with due regard to parallelism in size (see p. <a href="#page77">77</a>).
  It is well known that the complexity of a brain bears a distinct relation
  to the size of its possessor within the group. Now the most ancient
  Marsupials are decidedly more Polyprotodont-like. No European form from
  the earlier periods is distinctly to be referred to the Diprotodonts. But
  both divisions now exist in America and Australia.</p>

  <p>We must assume, therefore, one of three hypotheses. Either the
  differentiation into the two great divisions occurred in Jurassic or
  Cretaceous times before the migration of the order southwards; or the
  Diprotodont type is only a type, and not a natural group, <i>i.e.</i> it
  has been separately evolved in America and Australia; or, finally, there
  was formerly a land-connexion in the Antarctic hemisphere, along which
  the Diprotodonts of Australia wandered into South America. The middle
  hypothesis has this to commend it, that syndactylism occurs in both
  divisions, and that in some Diprotodonts the pouch opens backwards as it
  does in the Polyprotodonts. So great are the resemblances that but little
  difference is really left&mdash;of great importance that is to say. Hence
  it is not difficult to imagine the reduction of the incisors having taken
  place twice. In favour of the first hypothesis there are no positive
  facts. Finally, in favour of the last, which is so strongly supported by
  the facts of distribution derived from the study of other groups of
  animals,<a name="NtA_70" href="#Nt_70"><sup>[70]</sup></a> there is at
  least this striking fact or rather series of facts: that some of the
  South American fossil Polyprotodonts have a "strictly Dasyurine
  relationship."<a name="NtA_71" href="#Nt_71"><sup>[71]</sup></a> If there
  has not been a direct migration, then the Dasyurine type has been twice
  evolved, an improbability that few will attempt to explain away. In any
  case we shall adopt here the usual division of the Marsupials into
  Diprotodontia and Polyprotodontia.</p>

<h5><span class="sc">Sub-Order 1.</span> DIPROTODONTIA.</h5>

  <p>This group includes the herbivorous Marsupials. The incisors are as a
  rule three above, but one only in the Wombats. Below <!-- Page 129
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page129"></a>{129}</span>is one strong
  pair, with occasionally one or two rudimentary incisors. The upper
  canines, if present, are not large. The molars are tuberculate or ridged.
  All Marsupials (except the Wombats) to some extent, and the Macropods
  especially, are characterised by the prolongation of the tubes of the
  dentine into the clear enamel. The significance of this fact is, however,
  lessened by the fact that the same penetration of the enamel by dentinal
  tubes occurs in the Jerboa, the Hyrax, and some Shrews. The feet have two
  syndactylous toes,<a name="NtA_72" href="#Nt_72"><sup>[72]</sup></a> less
  marked in the Wombats than in the Kangaroos and Phalangers.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Macropodidae.</b>&mdash;This family contains the Kangaroos,
  Wallabies, Rat-Kangaroos, and Tree-Kangaroos. With the exception of
  <i>Dendrolagus</i> the family is terrestrial, and its numerous species
  progress by leaps effected by the long hind-limbs, which are decidedly,
  often greatly, longer than the fore-limbs. In the hind-limb the fourth
  toe is very long and strong; the fifth moderately so; the second and
  third are slender and united by skin. The tail is always long, but
  differs in its characters from <!-- Page 131 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page131"></a>{131}</span>genus to genus. The stomach is much
  sacculated. The dental formula is I&nbsp;3/1 C&nbsp;(1 or 0)/0 P&nbsp;2/2 M&nbsp;4/4. The
  atlas is often open below, forming thus an incomplete ring.</p>

  <p>Though the number of the incisor teeth in the adult Diprotodonts is
  never more than three on each side in each jaw, more numerous rudiments
  are present. Mr. M. Woodward<a name="NtA_73"
  href="#Nt_73"><sup>[73]</sup></a> has lately investigated the subject
  with interesting results. He finds that many species present decided
  traces of two additional incisors, raising the total to that which
  characterises the Polyprotodontia; but in two cases, viz. <i>Macropus
  giganteus</i> and <i>Petrogale penicillata</i>, a sixth is present, the
  total number being thus in excess of that found in any other Marsupial.
  This, as the author himself admits, proves too much. No mammal is known
  which in the adult condition has so many incisors; nor do the fossil
  Mammalia help us to get over the difficulty; even among reptiles it is
  not usual for so many teeth to occur upon the premaxillaries.</p>

  <p>It is a curious fact that the two long lower incisors can be used
  after the fashion of a pair of scissors, or rather a pair of shears.
  Their inner edges are sharpened, and they are capable of some motion
  towards and away from each other; by their means grass is cropped.</p>

  <p>The stomach of <i>Macropus</i> (and of other allied genera) is
  peculiar by reason of its long and sacculated character; the oesophagus
  enters it very near the cardiac end, which is bifid. Messrs. Schäfer and
  Williams<a name="NtA_74" href="#Nt_74"><sup>[74]</sup></a> have shown
  that the squamous, non-glandular epithelium of the oesophagus extends
  over the greater part of the stomach, only the pyloric extremity and one
  of the two cardiac caeca being lined with columnar epithelium.</p>

  <p>The Macropodidae are clearly divisible into three sub-families, which
  are distinguished by marked anatomical characters.</p>

  <p>In the sub-family <span class="sc">Macropodinae</span> (including the
  genera <i>Macropus</i>, <i>Petrogale</i>, <i>Lagorchestes</i>,
  <i>Dorcopsis</i>, <i>Dendrolagus</i>, <i>Onychogale</i>, and
  <i>Lagostrophus</i>) there is no hallux, and the tail is hairy. The
  oesophagus enters the stomach near the cardiac end. The caecum when short
  has no longitudinal bands; the liver has a Spigelian lobe.</p>

  <p>The second sub-family, <span class="sc">Potoroinae</span> or <span
  class="sc">Hypsiprymninae</span> (including the genera <i>Potorous</i>,
  <i>Aepyprymnus</i>, <i>Bettongia</i>, and <!-- Page 132 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page132"></a>{132}</span><i>Caloprymnus</i>),
  consists of smaller animals than the Macropodinae, which, however,
  resemble them in having no hallux, but a hairy tail. The oesophagus
  enters the stomach near the pyloric end of that organ. The caecum, though
  short, has lateral longitudinal bands. The liver has no special Spigelian
  lobe. The canines are always present, being rarely so in Macropodinae,
  and are usually well developed.</p>

  <p>The third sub-family, that of the <span
  class="sc">Hypsiprymnodontidae</span>, is doubtfully referable to the
  family; it consists of but one genus <i>Hypsiprymnodon</i>, which is in
  many points more like a Phalanger than a Kangaroo. It has an opposable
  hallux and a non-hairy, but scaly, tail. It has canines in the upper
  jaw.</p>

<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 66.&mdash;Red Kangaroo. <i>Macropus rufus.</i> × <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">18</span>.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 1. Macropodinae.</b>&mdash;The genus <i>Macropus</i>
  includes not only the Kangaroos but also the Wallabies, which are really
  indistinguishable, though they have sometimes been placed in a separate
  genus <i>Halmaturus</i>. The genus thus enlarged contains twenty-three
  species. It may be thus characterised: the ears are long, the rhinarium
  is usually naked, but in <i>M. giganteus</i> and others a band of hairs
  descends to the upper lip; a naked band extends from the ankle to the
  pads on the digits, which is interrupted in <i>M. rufus</i> by a band of
  hairs just in front of the digits. The mammae are four. The tail is not
  bushy, <!-- Page 133 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page133"></a>{133}</span>but is crested in <i>M. irma</i>. They are
  for the most part found on the Australian continent, but some species are
  found in the islands to the north which belong to the Australian region.
  Thus <i>M. brunii</i>, which is of interest as the first Kangaroo seen by
  a European, is a native of the Aru islands. A specimen of this animal,
  which was then living in the garden of the Dutch governor of Batavia, was
  described by Bruyn in the year 1711. <i>M. rufus</i>, the largest member
  of the group, is remarkable for the red secretion which adorns the neck
  of the male. It is caused by particles which have the appearance and
  colour of carmine. <i>M. giganteus</i> is not, as its specific name might
  imply, the "giant" of the race; its dimensions are given as 5 feet, while
  <i>M. rufus</i> is said to attain a length of 5 feet 5 inches, exclusive
  (in both cases) of the tail.</p>

  <p>The account which Sir Joseph Banks gives<a name="NtA_75"
  href="#Nt_75"><sup>[75]</sup></a> in his diary of the Kangaroo is
  interesting, since he was one of the first naturalists to see that
  creature. In July 1770 it was reported to him that an "animal as large as
  a greyhound, of a mouse colour, and very swift" had been seen by his
  people. A little later he was surprised to observe that the animal "went
  only upon two legs, making vast bounds just as the jerboa does." The
  second lieutenant killed one of these Kangaroos, of which Sir Joseph
  Banks wrote that "to compare it to any European animal would be
  impossible, as it has not the least resemblance to any one I have seen.
  Its fore-limbs are extremely short and of no use to it in walking; its
  hind, again, as disproportionately long; with these it hops seven or
  eight feet at a time, in the same manner as the jerboa, to which animal
  indeed it bears much resemblance, except in size, this being in weight 38
  lbs., and the jerboa no larger than a common rat." The beast was killed
  and eaten, and proved excellent meat. Sir Joseph Banks' observations upon
  the leaping of the Kangaroo are of interest, because it is often asserted
  that the tail is largely made use of as a third foot or as a support. Mr.
  Aflalo declares in the most positive way that after repeatedly examining
  the tracks upon soft sand immediately after the animal had passed, not
  the very faintest trace of the impression of the tail could be
  discovered. The leaps of a big Kangaroo seem to be somewhat greater than
  is recorded <!-- Page 134 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page134"></a>{134}</span>by Banks. It is said that 15 or even 20
  feet are covered at a bound, and in bound after bound. But in walking
  slowly it can be readily seen from an inspection of Kangaroos at the
  Zoological Society's Gardens that the animal does rest upon its tail,
  which with the hind-legs forms a tripod.</p>

  <p><i>Petrogale</i> with six species comes next to <i>Macropus</i>, and
  is indeed only to be differentiated from it by the thickly-haired and
  more slender tail, which is not used, as it is sometimes in the
  Kangaroos, as an extra hind-limb. The Rock-Kangaroos live among rocks,
  which they climb, and from which they leap; and the tail acts rather as a
  balancing pole. The most elaborate account of the anatomy of
  <i>Petrogale</i> known to me is by Mr. Parsons.<a name="NtA_76"
  href="#Nt_76"><sup>[76]</sup></a> The dentition as given by Mr. Thomas is
  I&nbsp;3/1 C&nbsp;0/0 Pm&nbsp;2/2 M&nbsp;4/4&mdash;that of <i>Macropus</i> without the
  occasionally occurring canine of the upper jaw. The osteological
  characters which separate it from <i>Macropus</i> are quite
  insignificant. Mr. Parsons mentions a wormian bone, "os epilepticum," at
  the junction of the coronal and sagittal sutures. It was found to occur
  in two out of five skulls examined, and appears not to occur in other
  Kangaroos. The palatine foramina of <i>Petrogale</i> are so large that
  the posterior part of the bone is only a narrow thickened ridge. The
  small intestine of <i>P. xanthopus</i> is 102 inches long, the large
  intestine 44 inches. The caecum has a length of 6 inches, and is not
  sacculated, differing in this from the caecum of <i>Macropus major</i>.
  The best known species are <i>P. xanthopus</i> and <i>P. penicillata</i>.
  The genus is confined to Australia itself, and does not enter
  Tasmania.</p>

  <p><i>Onychogale</i> includes the so-called "Nail-tailed Wallabies,"
  which have a thorn at the end of the tail, reminding one of the Lion and
  the Leopard, whose tails have a similar armature. The muffle is hairy.
  Three species are allowed by Mr. Thomas.</p>

  <p><i>Lagorchestes</i> has, like the last genus, the rhinarium,
  <i>i.e.</i> that part of the nose immediately surrounding the nostrils,
  hairy instead of smooth as in the Kangaroos proper. It is distinguished
  from <i>Onychogale</i> by the absence of the terminal callosity to the
  tail, which is rather short. The name Hare-Kangaroo is given to the
  members of this genus (three species) on account of their exceeding
  fleetness. This genus is limited to Australia itself. <i>L.
  conspicillatus</i> is said to present "a remarkable <!-- Page 135
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page135"></a>{135}</span>resemblance to
  the English hare," and <i>L. leporoides</i> was so called by Gould on
  account of general appearance as well as face.</p>

  <p><i>Dorcopsis</i> has shorter hind-legs than <i>Macropus</i>, and a
  naked muffle. The ears are small. The structure of <i>D. luctuosa</i> has
  been studied by Garrod,<a name="NtA_77" href="#Nt_77"><sup>[77]</sup></a>
  who pointed out the existence of four enlarged hair follicles on the neck
  near the mandibular symphysis. These are, however, represented in the
  next genus <i>Dendrolagus</i>, and occur also in <i>Petrogale</i>. The
  limbs are not so disproportionate as in <i>Macropus</i>, and the tail is
  naked at the tip.</p>

  <p><i>Dorcopsis</i> and the next genus to be described,
  <i>Dendrolagus</i>, differ from <i>Macropus</i> and its immediate allies,
  <i>Petrogale</i> and <i>Lagorchestes</i>, in a number of anatomical
  points. In the first place, the premolars are twice the size of those of
  <i>Macropus</i>, and they have a characteristic pattern not observable in
  the Kangaroos. This consists of a median ridge (the whole tooth being
  rather prismatic in shape), with lateral ridges at right angles to it.
  The upper canines are developed, but are minute.</p>

  <p>The stomach is not quite like that of <i>Macropus</i>, though built
  upon a similar plan. The blind cardiac extremity is a single, not a
  double cul-de-sac; in this it is like that of <i>Petrogale</i>. The
  distribution of the squamous, white, oesophageal epithelium is very much
  like that of <i>Dendrolagus</i>. In both genera the orifice of the
  oesophagus into the stomach is guarded by two strong longitudinal folds,
  which run for some distance towards the pylorus. In <i>Dendrolagus</i>,
  at any rate, this tract is bordered on each side by glandular patches. In
  <i>Dendrolagus</i>, moreover, the squamous epithelium does not extend
  into the cardiac cul-de-sac. This latter is separated from the rest of
  the stomach by two slightly diverging folds, which are faintly
  represented in <i>Petrogale</i> and in <i>Halmaturus</i>. In the last two
  genera the folds surrounding the oesophageal orifice are but slightly
  represented; better in <i>Halmaturus</i> than in <i>Petrogale</i>. But
  there are not the patches of glands already referred to. The small
  intestine of <i>Dorcopsis</i> is 97 inches in length, the large being 32,
  <i>i.e.</i> proportionately long, as in Marsupials generally. The small
  caecum (2½ inches) is not sacculated.</p>

  <p>The spleen is Macropodine, being <img src="images/t.png"
  class="middle" style="height:2ex;" alt="T" />-shaped or <img
  src="images/y.png" class="middle" style="height:2ex;" alt="Y" />-shaped.
  The differences between <i>Dorcopsis</i> and the evidently closely allied
  <i>Dendrolagus</i> will be further considered under the description of
  <!-- Page 136 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page136"></a>{136}</span>the latter. <i>Dorcopsis</i> is confined
  to New Guinea, and contains three species, viz. <i>D. muelleri</i>, <i>D.
  luctuosa</i>, and <i>D. macleani</i>. <i>D. muelleri</i> has a striking
  resemblance to <i>Macropus brunii</i>, with which it has been confounded.
  Though intermediate between <i>Macropus</i> and <i>Dendrolagus</i>, these
  Kangaroos are not arboreal.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Dendrolagus</i> is remarkable for its un-kangaroo-like
  habit of living in trees. In accordance with this change of habit is a
  relative shortening of the hind-limbs, a feature which begins to be
  observable in <i>Dorcopsis</i>. "The general build," writes Mr. Thomas,
  "is of the ordinary mammalian proportions, not macropodiform at all." The
  muffle is not naked for the greater part, though the shortness of the
  hairs gives that effect. As in <i>Dorcopsis</i>, but not as in
  <i>Macropus</i>, the bulla tympani is not swollen. There are altogether
  five species, the fifth, <i>D. bennetti</i>, having been lately described
  from specimens living in the Zoological Society's Gardens.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:41%;">

  <p>The anatomy of this genus has been described by Owen for <i>D.
  inustus</i>,<a name="NtA_78" href="#Nt_78"><sup>[78]</sup></a> and by
  myself for <i>D. bennetti</i>. The stomach, which <!-- Page 137 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page137"></a>{137}</span>has a single, not
  bifid, cul-de-sac, is sacculated by two principal bands and other
  subsidiary ones. Its internal structure has already been to some extent
  described. The spleen of <i>D. bennetti</i> is remarkable for the fact
  that it is not <img src="images/t.png" class="middle" style="height:2ex;" alt="T"
  />-shaped, whereas <i>D. inustus</i> agrees with other Macropodines in
  the form of this organ. The small intestine of <i>D. bennetti</i> is 95
  inches long, the large 38. The caecum appears to differ in the two
  species; it is smaller in <i>D. bennetti</i>, where it is only 2 inches
  in length. The most remarkable feature of the liver is the large size of
  the left lateral lobe and the bilobed condition of the Spigelian lobe;
  this at least was the case with <i>D. bennetti</i>. A recently-described
  species<a name="NtA_79" href="#Nt_79"><sup>[79]</sup></a> has been
  attentively studied in its native haunts by Dr. Lumholtz.<a name="NtA_80"
  href="#Nt_80"><sup>[80]</sup></a> It lives in the highest parts of the
  mountainous scrubs of Queensland, where it moves quickly on the ground as
  well as among the trees. It is hunted with Dingos by the "blacks," and is
  eaten by them.<a name="NtA_81" href="#Nt_81"><sup>[81]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Lagostrophus</i> is a generic name that has been proposed by Mr.
  Thomas for a small Wallaby 18 inches in length, which is distinguished by
  the fact that the long claws of the hind-limbs are entirely hidden by
  long and bristly hairs; the muffle is naked; there is no canine. The
  bullae are swollen. There is but one species of the genus, <i>L.
  fasciatus</i>, a native of West Australia.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 2. Potoroinae.</b>&mdash;<i>Aepyprymnus</i> and the other
  genera placed in this sub-family are known by the vernacular name of
  Rat-Kangaroos, or sometimes Kangaroo-Rats. The latter term has been
  called "incorrect," though it is just as good as the former, both of them
  in fact being inaccurate as implying some likeness to or relation with a
  Rat. The present genus has a partially hairy rhinarium; the auditory
  bullae are not swollen. It contains but one species, <i>Ae.
  rufescens</i>, a native of Eastern Australia, which is distinguished by
  its very long hind-feet.</p>

  <p><i>Bettongia</i> has long hind-feet as in <i>Aepyprymnus</i>, but the
  rhinarium is entirely naked instead of being partially hairy, while the
  ears are much shorter. The genus, which contains four species, is
  remarkable as being the only ground-living mammal with a prehensile tail,
  which it uses to carry grass, etc. <!-- Page 138 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page138"></a>{138}</span><i>B. lesueuri</i>
  burrows in the ground, often to so great a depth as 10 feet. The genus
  occurs in Tasmania as well as in Australia.</p>

  <p><i>Caloprymnus</i>, with one species, is a genus instituted by Mr.
  Thomas in his Catalogue of Marsupials for a form (<i>C. campestris</i>)
  which combines in a remarkable way the characters of <i>Aepyprymnus</i>,
  <i>Bettongia</i>, and <i>Potorous</i>. The external characters and the
  general shape of the skull are as in <i>Bettongia</i>, while the molars
  have the structure of those of <i>Aepyprymnus</i>. The last premolar is
  as in <i>Potorous</i>.</p>

  <p>Of the genus <i>Potorous</i> there are three species, which are
  Tasmanian as well as Australian. Unlike the other Rat-Kangaroos, the
  hind-feet are comparatively short, and the animal is therefore less
  addicted to jumping than its relatives. The rhinarium is naked, and the
  ears are of fair length.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 3. Hypsiprymnodontinae.</b>&mdash;The Musk-Kangaroo,
  <i>Hypsiprymnodon</i>, is the last genus of the present family, and the
  only genus of this sub-family. It is intermediate between the
  Macropodidae and the Phalangeridae, the annectant character being mainly
  the hind-feet, which though they have the same long fourth digit as the
  Kangaroos, have it more feebly developed, and possess also an opposable
  hallux, which is one of the salient features in the structure of the
  Phalangeridae. The tail is naked and scaly; the rhinarium is entirely
  naked. The ears are large and not furry. The single species, <i>H.
  moschatus</i>, appears to feed upon insects as well as vegetables.</p>

  <p>"Its habits are chiefly diurnal, and its actions when not disturbed by
  no means ungraceful. It progresses in much the same manner as the
  Kangaroo-Rats (<i>Potorous</i>), to which it is closely allied, but
  procures its food by turning over the débris in the scrubs in search of
  insects, worms, and tuberous roots, frequently eating the palm berries,
  which it holds in its fore-paws after the manner of the Phalangers,
  sitting up on its haunches, or sometimes digging like the bandicoots."
  This is Mr. Ramsay's description of the animal, which he was the first to
  discover.<a name="NtA_82" href="#Nt_82"><sup>[82]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Phalangeridae.</b>&mdash;The genus <i>Hypsiprymnodon</i>
  bridges over the not very wide gap which separates the Kangaroos from the
  Phalangers. The Phalangers are Marsupials with five fingers and toes; the
  second and third toes are bound together by a <!-- Page 139 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page139"></a>{139}</span>common integument as in
  the Macropodidae. The hallux is opposable and nailless. The tail is
  nearly always long and prehensile. The pouch is well developed; the
  stomach not sacculated; a caecum is present (except in <i>Tarsipes</i>).
  These are really the principal distinctions between the two families. In
  addition, it may be mentioned that the lower incisors have not a
  scissor-like action as in the Kangaroos.</p>

  <p>The Phalangers may be divided into four sub-families.</p>

  <p>The first of these, that of the <span class="sc">Phalangerinae</span>,
  contains the genera <i>Phalanger</i> (including <i>Cuscus</i>),
  <i>Acrobates</i>, <i>Distaechurus</i>, <i>Dromicia</i>,
  <i>Gymnobelideus</i>, <i>Petaurus</i>, <i>Petauroides</i>,
  <i>Dactylopsila</i>, <i>Pseudochirus</i>, and <i>Trichosurus</i>.</p>

  <p>These genera agree in the following generalities<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span>Tail well developed, often very long; three
  incisors above, and at least two premolars both above and below; caecum
  long and simple; stomach without a cardiac gland; liver not very
  complicated by secondary furrows, with a distinct caudate lobe; the
  vaginal median culs-de-sac often coalesced; lungs with an azygos
  lobe.</p>

<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 69.&mdash;Vulpine Phalanger. <i>Trichosurus vulpecula.</i> × <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">6</span>.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 1. Phalangerinae.</b>&mdash;The genus <i>Phalanger</i>
  embraces five species, sometimes called by the generic name of
  <i>Cuscus</i>. They are largish animals with short ears; only the end of
  the tail is naked. Of these animals only one species is found in
  Australia itself, the rest inhabiting the islands lying to the north. The
  Spotted Cuscus, <i>Ph. maculatus</i>, is in spite of its vegetarian diet,
  and perhaps on account of its spots, spoken of as the "Tiger Cat." Mr.
  Aflalo remarks of it that though provided with a prehensile tail, it is
  little better as a climber than the tailless Koala.</p>

  <p><i>Trichosurus</i>, including the "True Phalangers," includes largish
  species, which can be distinguished from the last genus by a chest-gland
  similar to that which occurs in <i>Myrmecobius</i> and some other
  Marsupials of the present group. There are but two species, which are
  purely Australian. The "Brush-tailed Opossum," <i>T. vulpecula</i>
  (perhaps better known as <i>Phalangista</i> <!-- Page 141 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page141"></a>{141}</span><i>vulpina</i>), like
  its American pseudo-namesake (a true Opossum, genus <i>Didelphys</i>),
  "plays 'possum" on occasions. The dental formula is I&nbsp;3/2 C&nbsp;1/0 Pm&nbsp;2/3
  M&nbsp;4/4. The ears are shortish.</p>

  <p>The Ring-tailed Phalangers, <i>Pseudochirus</i>, are more widely
  distributed than the last two genera; they range from Tasmania in the
  south to New Guinea in the north. They are not, however, ring-tailed,
  though the tip of the tail is generally white. As in the last genera,
  which have prehensile tails, the end of this appendage is naked. The
  mammae are four. The tooth formula is I&nbsp;3/2 C&nbsp;1/0 Pm&nbsp;3/3 M&nbsp;4/4. There are
  some ten species of the genus.</p>

  <p>The Striped Phalanger, <i>Dactylopsila trivirgata</i>, is an animal
  about a foot long, whose identity can be ascertained by its striped,
  black and white skin. It is an arboreal creature that lives apparently
  both on leaves and grubs like so many arboreal creatures of quite
  different groups&mdash;Squirrels, for instance, and New-World Monkeys.
  The tooth formula is I&nbsp;3/3 C&nbsp;1/6 Pm&nbsp;3/2 M&nbsp;4/4.</p>

  <p><i>Gymnobelideus leadbeateri</i> is a small creature with a body 6
  inches in length. It is restricted to the colony of Victoria. The general
  look is that of <i>Petaurus</i>; the ears are naked.</p>

  <p><i>Dromicia</i> is a genus of Phalangers which although devoid of a
  parachute, such as is possessed by certain genera that will be considered
  immediately, is able to leap with great agility from branch to branch.
  The ears are large and thin and almost naked; the tooth formula is I&nbsp;3/2
  C&nbsp;1/0 Pm&nbsp;3/3 M&nbsp;4/4. They are minute creatures, the longest measuring,
  with the tail, but 10 inches. Dormouse-Phalanger is a name sometimes
  given to them. There are four species, ranging from Tasmania to New
  Guinea. The name Dormouse as applied to the genus seems to be owing to
  the way in which they hold a nut in the paws when feeding. <i>D. nana</i>
  is 4 inches long, with a tail of nearly the same length. It is thick at
  the base.</p>

  <p><i>Distaechurus</i> is the last genus of non-flying Phalangers. Its
  name refers to the arrangement of the hairs on the tail, which are
  disposed on either side in a row like the vane of a feather. The tooth
  formula is I&nbsp;3/2 C&nbsp;1/0 Pm&nbsp;3/2 M&nbsp;3/3, very nearly as in <i>Acrobates</i>.
  The ears are as in that genus.</p>

  <p><i>Petaurus</i> is the first genus of the Flying Phalangers, all of
  which are provided with a parachute-like expansion of the skin between
  the fore- and hind-limbs; the ears are large and naked; and the tooth
  formula is I&nbsp;3/2 C&nbsp;1/0 Pm&nbsp;3/3 M&nbsp;4/4. There are three <!-- Page 142
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page142"></a>{142}</span>species of the
  genus, which extend through pretty well the entire Australian region. The
  term "flying" as applied to these and the other "flying" genera is of
  course an exaggeration. The animals cannot fly upwards; they can only
  descend in a skimming fashion, the folds of skin breaking their fall.
  <i>P. breviceps</i> is perhaps the best-known species. The body is 8, the
  tail 9 inches long.</p>

  <p><i>Petauroides</i> seems to be chiefly distinguished from
  <i>Petaurus</i> by the fact that, as in its ally <i>Dactylopsila</i>, the
  tail is partly naked terminally. In <i>Petaurus</i> and
  <i>Gymnobelideus</i> the tail is bushy to the very end, including its
  extreme tip below.</p>

  <p>A third genus of Flying Phalangers is the minute <i>Acrobates</i>,
  which has a distichous tail like that of <i>Distaechurus</i>. It is not
  more than 6 inches in length including the tail. As to these Flying
  Phalangers it is exceedingly instructive to observe that the same method
  of "flight" has been apparently evolved three times; for the three genera
  are each of them specially related to a separate type of non-flying
  Phalanger. The same observation can be made about the Flying Squirrels,
  <i>Anomalurus</i> and <i>Sciuropterus</i>. The dental formula is I&nbsp;3/2
  C&nbsp;1/0 Pm&nbsp;3/3 M&nbsp;3/3. The ears are thinly clad with hair. There are four
  teats.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 2. Phascolarctinae.</b>&mdash;The Koala, or Native Bear,
  <i>Phascolarctos cinereus</i>, is the only representative of its
  sub-family. It is, like the Wombat, aberrant in the lack of an obvious
  tail. The absence of this appendage is curious in an arboreal creature
  whose near allies have a long and prehensile one. The structure of the
  Koala was investigated by the late Mr. W. A. Forbes.<a name="NtA_83"
  href="#Nt_83"><sup>[83]</sup></a> There are some unexpected points of
  likeness to the Wombat: thus they agree in the absence of the tail, in
  the structure of the stomach, and in the great subdivision of the lobes
  of the liver. The brain, however, is smooth, and the caecum is
  exceedingly large and complicated in structure, that of the Wombat being
  short. That both animals have cheek-pouches is perhaps due to similar
  habits of temporarily storing masses of food. This animal has only eleven
  pairs of ribs. The tail has only seven or eight vertebra, and these have
  no chevron-bones.</p>

  <p>A peculiarity of the skull is seen in the great size of the
  alisphenoid bulla, which is comparable in size and appearance with that
  of the Pig. As in the Kangaroos, the atlas is incomplete below. <!-- Page
  143 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page143"></a>{143}</span></p>

  <p>The tooth formula of the genus is I&nbsp;3/1 C&nbsp;1/0 Pm&nbsp;1/1 M&nbsp;4/(4 or 5). The
  additional lower molar seems to be exceptional, and has been found in one
  specimen only.</p>

  <p>In the alimentary tract the most remarkable structure is the large
  intestine, which is very capacious for the first 28 inches or so of its
  course. This section of the colon is lined with rugae precisely like
  those which are found in the caecum. These folds, which at first are some
  twelve in number, fuse lower down, and by the time that the colon
  approaches the external orifice are reduced to five. Similar folds, as
  already stated, occur in the caecum, but do not extend as far as its
  blind end. The caecum is proportionately and actually larger than in any
  other Marsupial. The gall-bladder is unusually elongated.</p>

<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 70.&mdash;Koala. <i>Phascolarctos cinereus.</i> × <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">9</span>.</p>

  <p>The Koala is mainly crepuscular or nocturnal in its habits. It feeds
  so exclusively upon the leaves of the gum-tree (<i>Eucalyptus</i>) that
  it is impossible to keep the creature long in captivity in lands where
  that particular kind of food is not available.</p>

  <p>The female, though she seems to bear but a single young one, which is
  carried on the back after the fashion of some Opossums, has two nipples.
  The animal's slow habits seem to require a nocturnal and retired life. It
  is about as lethargic as the Sloth, and it is said to further resemble
  that animal in clinging firmly to a branch even after it is shot. <!--

<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 71.&mdash;Wombat. <i>Phascolomys wombat.</i> × <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">12</span>.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 3. Phascolomyinae.</b>&mdash;<i>Phascolomys</i>, the
  Wombat, is the only genus of this sub-family. This animal has the
  appearance of a heavily-built Marmot, like which it has a mere stump for
  a tail, and a pair of strong chisel-shaped and Rodent-like incisors,
  which, however, differ from those of Rodents in having a complete coating
  of cement. All the teeth of the animal are rootless, and there are no
  canines. The incisors have enamel on the front and lateral faces only.
  The dental formula is I&nbsp;1/1 C&nbsp;0/0 Pm&nbsp;1/1 M&nbsp;4/4. The affinities with other
  Diprotodont Marsupials are shown by the commencing syndactyly of the
  second and third toes. The rhinarium is naked or hairy. There is a
  rudimentary cheek-pouch, as in <i>Phascolarctos</i>. The Wombat has, like
  the Koala, and also the Beaver&mdash;which does away with some of the
  value of the comparison&mdash;a peculiar gland-patch in the stomach, a
  raised area of collected glands. In no other Marsupial is such a
  structure found, "whilst in the two forms under consideration its
  identity is almost precise. That such a unique structure should have been
  independently developed in two forms unrelated to each other, appears to
  me to be in the highest degree improbable." This is Mr. Forbes' opinion.
  It might be strengthened by adding the observation that, as there are
  other points of likeness between the Wombat and the Koala, it seems more
  unlikely that a structure so nearly identical should have been twice <!--
  Page 145 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page145"></a>{145}</span>developed in two not very distant forms.
  As in the Kangaroos, the atlas is open below. <i>Ph. ursinus</i> has 15
  ribs; the other species the normal (for Marsupials) 13. Other points of
  likeness will be mentioned under the description of the Koala. These
  animals mainly feed upon roots; they live in companies in burrows. There
  are three species&mdash;<i>Ph. ursinus</i>, <i>Ph. latifrons</i>, and
  <i>Ph. mitchelli</i>. <i>Ph. ursinus</i> is Tasmanian in range, the other
  two species South Australian.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 4. Tarsipedinae.</b>&mdash;The genus <i>Tarsipes</i> ought
  perhaps to be removed from the present family. There is but a single
  species, which is a small creature of 7 inches in total length, of which
  the tail measures 4 inches. The teeth are much dwindled, the formula
  being I&nbsp;2/1 C&nbsp;1/0 Pm&nbsp;1/0 M&nbsp;3/3 = 22. The lower incisors are procumbent.
  The lower jaw, moreover, has not the characteristic Marsupial inflection.
  The intestinal canal is without the caecum present in the remaining
  Phalangeridae. It is a curious fact that this aberrant little Phalanger
  should come from Western Australia, like the even more aberrant
  <i>Myrmecobius</i>. Like the latter also, <i>Tarsipes</i> has a long
  exsertile tongue, with which, however, it extracts honey from flowers.
  Probably it also catches minute insects in the corollas of the flowers.
  It has been proved, in fact, that in captivity at any rate the animal is
  insectivorous; for it has been known to eat moths.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Epanorthidae.</b>&mdash;The extinct Epanorthidae of <!--
  Page 146 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page146"></a>{146}</span>Patagonia are represented to-day by a
  small Marsupial which has been rediscovered within the last two or three
  years. This little animal, formerly called <i>Hyracodon</i> (a
  pre-occupied name), is now termed <i>Caenolestes</i>, and is a native of
  Colombia and Ecuador. There are two species, and of these <i>C.
  obscurus</i> is called by the inhabitants "Raton runcho," which means
  opossum-rat. It lives apparently upon bird's eggs and small birds, though
  it belongs to the Diprotodont division of the Marsupials.
  <i>Caenolestes</i>, however, although diprotodont, has not the
  syndactylous character of the digits of the feet already referred to in
  the Kangaroos and their allies. The pouch is small and rudimentary. The
  dentition is I&nbsp;4/3 C&nbsp;1/1 Pm&nbsp;3/3 M&nbsp;4/4 = 46, and the teeth are said by Mr.
  Thomas to be much like those of the Australian <i>Dromicia</i>.<a
  name="NtA_84" href="#Nt_84"><sup>[84]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In the skull a peculiarity which does not bear upon its affinities to
  other Marsupials, but is still interesting, is mentioned by Mr. Thomas.
  The nasals are not sufficiently prolonged to meet the upper edge of the
  maxillae, and so a vacuity is left, as in the skulls of many Ruminants
  (<i>e.g.</i> the Sable Antelope). The palate is very imperfect; the
  foramina, which render it so, reach as far forward as the last premolar.
  The lower jaw has quite the appearance of that of a <i>Macropus</i> or
  <i>Phalanger</i>, with long and forwardly projecting incisors.</p>

  <p><b>Extinct Diprotodonts.</b>&mdash;The great <i>Diprotodon</i> is a
  creature with a skull a yard long, which must have been of the size of a
  large Rhinoceros. Though closely allied to <i>Macropus</i>, it seems that
  this great beast did not hop after the fashion of a Kangaroo, its limbs
  being of a more equal size than in the Kangaroo. Recently some further
  remains of <i>Diprotodon</i> have been discovered in a lake known as Lake
  Mulligan, where they had apparently been bogged. Professor Stirling has
  contributed an account of these remains, which fills up a considerable
  gap in our knowledge. He has been able to state the structure of the
  fore- and hind-limbs. Both limbs are pentadactyle, the fingers of the
  fore-limb being approximately equal in length and general development. In
  the hind-limb the hallux is small, and consists of the metatarsal only.
  This bone is fixed in the position of "extreme abduction," and is
  suggestive of an arboreal limb. Digits two and three may have <!-- Page
  147 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page147"></a>{147}</span>been
  syndactylous, and the authors of the account<a name="NtA_85"
  href="#Nt_85"><sup>[85]</sup></a> of these bones think that the fourth
  toe may have shared in this syndactyly. The metatarsal of the fifth digit
  is enormously expanded at its edge, and seems to have furnished a strong
  support to the creature; this is also seen in the metacarpal of the
  fore-limb. Probably, therefore, <i>Diprotodon</i> was quadrupedal in its
  mode of progression, with the emphasis laid upon the little finger and
  the little toe instead of, as in ourselves, the first toe. The hind-foot
  of the <i>Diprotodon</i> could not be more unlike that of a Kangaroo than
  it actually is.</p>

  <p>Another giant among these Marsupials was the genus <i>Thylacoleo</i>,
  whose name was given to it by Sir Richard Owen on the view that it was a
  Marsupial Tiger. Sir W. Flower has, however, controverted this opinion,
  and the genus is in fact, in spite of its large size, closely allied to
  the Phalangers and <!-- Page 148 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page148"></a>{148}</span>Cuscuses.<a name="NtA_86"

  <p><i>Nototherium</i> was a creature smaller than <i>Diprotodon</i>, but
  still of large size; it is believed to have been a burrowing creature,
  and to connect the Wombats with <i>Diprotodon</i>. More certainly allied
  to the existing Wombat was <i>Phascolonus</i>, a Wombat as big as a
  Tapir.</p>

  <p>Of extinct American Diprotodonts the Epanorthidae, already referred to
  in connexion with the living <i>Caenolestes</i>, were the most prominent
  forms. The genus <i>Epanorthus</i> occurs in the Santa Cruz formation of
  Patagonia, which is believed to be Miocene. The incisors are three in the
  upper jaw; and the single incisor of each ramus of the lower jaw is a
  great chisel-shaped, cutting instrument.</p>

  <p><i>Abderites</i> is also typically Diprotodont by reason of the large
  projecting incisors of the lower jaw. It has a large cutting tooth in the
  lower jaw, which appears to be the last premolar, and is thus comparable
  to the great cutting tooth of the lower jaw and of the upper jaw of the
  extinct Phalanger, <i>Thylacoleo</i>. <!-- Page 149 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page149"></a>{149}</span>It may also be
  comparable to the great premolar of such Multituberculata as
  <i>Ptilodus</i> and <i>Plagiaulax</i>. It is, moreover, marked with
  vertical grooves.</p>

  <p>An interesting form, which is unfortunately but little known, is the
  Australian and Pleistocene genus <i>Triclis</i>, with one species, <i>T.
  oscillans</i>. In having a minute canine tooth in the lower jaw it agrees
  with some Phalangeridae, and being otherwise closely allied to
  <i>Hypsiprymnodon</i>, it unites the Macropodidae with the
  Phalangeridae.</p>

<h5><span class="sc">Sub-Order 2.</span> POLYPROTODONTIA.</h5>

  <p>In this mainly carnivorous or insectivorous division of the Marsupials
  the incisors are four or five on each side of the upper jaw, and one or
  two fewer in the lower jaw. Figs. 76 and 77 illustrate the Polyprotodont
  and Diprotodont dentitions. The canines are those of flesh-eaters and so
  are the molars, being as a rule sharply cuspidate. As a rule, which has
  an exception in the Peramelidae, there is no syndactylism of toes in the
  hind-foot. This sub-order is at the present day Australian and American
  in its range.</p>

  bands. The hallux is entirely wanting; the pouch opens backwards. The

  name="page151"></a>{151}</span>is getting rarer on account of its
  sheep-killing propensities, and the consequent war of extermination
  declared upon it by the colonists. It will, however, feed upon other
  animals; and it is related that the first specimen ever captured had in
  its stomach the remains of an Echidna! Mr. Thomas thinks that the
  persistence of this and of some of the other larger carnivorous
  Marsupials in Tasmania after their extinction in Australia is not
  unconnected with the advent of the Dingo. But it is stated that the
  Thylacine is quite capable of keeping even a pack of dogs at bay.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Sarcophilus</i> has been frequently confounded with the
  next, but it is kept apart by Mr. Thomas, who follows Cuvier in this. An
  alternative generic name is <i>Diabolus</i>, which, like the first name,
  refers to the habits and character of the single species which this genus
  contains. The genus is more like <i>Thylacinus</i> than is
  <i>Dasyurus</i>. The hallux is wanting, and the teeth, though fewer in
  number (42), resemble those of the Thylacine more closely than do those
  of the Dasyure. The species is called <i>S. ursinus</i>, the popular name
  being Tasmanian Devil. It is black with a variable number of white
  patches on the body. It is of about the size of a Badger, and is, like
  the Thylacine, a nocturnal animal. The Tasmanian Devil is said to be one
  of the most ferocious of animals, and to express its ferocity by a
  "yelling growl."</p>

  <p>The next genus of this family, <i>Dasyurus</i>, comprises five
  species, which range over the whole of the Papuan and Australian
  sub-regions. The general form is Viverrine, and the hallux is sometimes
  present though small. The dental formula is as in the last genus, but the
  teeth "are more insectivorous in their character." There are six or eight
  mammae. The members of this genus are grey or brown, and spotted with
  white; they are all arboreal, and feed largely upon birds and their eggs.
  Mr. Thomas has pointed out that in two species, <i>D. viverrinus</i> and
  <i>D. geoffroyi</i>, the striae upon the foot-pads are absent, and that
  therefore these at least are probably not so purely arboreal as the rest.
  The animals are not diurnal, and during the day hide themselves in the
  hollow trunks of trees. They are spoken of as "Native Cats," but have the
  general habits of Martens. <i>D. maculatus</i> is common in Tasmania, but
  is rare in Australia, thus "approaching the condition now exhibited by
  the Thylacine and <!-- Page 153 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page153"></a>{153}</span>Tasmanian Devil, namely, complete
  extermination in Australia, where both once lived." <i>D. hallucatus</i>
  shows an approach to <i>Phascologale</i> in its five-toed hind-feet and
  slender build.</p>

  <p><i>Phascologale</i> is a genus which, like the last, is usually
  arboreal (although not <i>P. virginiae</i> of North Queensland), but is
  of much smaller size, the species not exceeding the dimensions of a rat.
  They have no spots, but there is sometimes a stripe down the back. There
  are thirteen species, which have the same range as the last genus. The
  hallux is present though small, but the pouch is "practically obsolete,"
  though there is a small fold of skin behind the teats. The rhinarium is
  naked; the tail is long, "bushy, crested, or nearly naked." The mammae
  are four to ten in number. The dental formula is as in <i>Dasyurus</i>,
  and the teeth are not very different in form; sometimes the last premolar
  is wanting. "The members of this genus," remarks Mr. Thomas, "evidently
  take the place in the Australian region filled in the Oriental by the
  Tupaiae, and in the Neotropical by the smaller Opossums."</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Sminthopsis</i> comprises not more than four species,
  even smaller than the last. The largest species, <i>S. virginiae</i>, is
  only 125 mm. in length. The hallux is present, and there is a
  well-developed pouch. There are forty-six teeth, as in the Dasyures. The
  feet are narrow with granulated or hairy soles, whereas in
  <i>Phascologale</i> they are broad with smooth soles. The mammae are
  eight or ten. The genus ranges through Australia and Tasmania.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Antechinomys</i> has but a single species, which is a
  native of Queensland and New South Wales. The build is Jerboa-like, and
  the animal is, as might be inferred, terrestrial. The ears are very long,
  and the limbs elongated; the hallux is absent; the teeth are exactly as
  in <i>Sminthopsis</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Antechinomys</i> has thirteen dorsal and seven lumbar vertebrae;
  three sacrals and twenty-five caudals, the latter number being in excess
  of that of its allies. The stomach is nearly globular, with approximated
  orifices; the intestine measured 6.8 inches, a little more than twice the
  length of the animal itself. <i>A. lanigera</i> is a native of East
  Central Australia, and appears to be entirely terrestrial in habit, and
  to progress by a series of leaps&mdash;at any rate when going at full
  speed.</p>

  <p>Professor Spencer, who found examples of this rare species, gives <!--
  Page 154 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page154"></a>{154}</span>an
  interesting description of its habits. <i>Antechinomys</i> has much the
  look of the Australian Rat, <i>Hapalotis mitchelli</i>; and as the two
  animals lead a similar kind of life, the resemblance is not unexpected.
  Professor Spencer wonders why these creatures are saltatory in habit. The
  country which they inhabit is arid, but with patches of grass and shrubs.
  For a big kangaroo the advantage of the power of leaping over such
  obstacles may be obvious, but not for the small and slender
  <i>Antechinomys</i>. The chief foes of this rare Marsupial appear to be
  predatory birds; and Professor Spencer thinks that the saltatory mode of
  progression may be more baffling to such pursuers than even a rapid
  run.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Dasyuroides</i> has been lately instituted by Professor
  Spencer for a Marsupial from Central Australia somewhat intermediate
  between <i>Sminthopsis</i> and <i>Phascologale</i>. As there is but one
  species, the generic will be considered with the specific characters.
  <i>D. byrnei</i> is an animal of about the size of the Common Rat. The
  hallux is absent. The tail is fairly thick, but not "incrassated." There
  are six mammae, and the pouch is but slightly developed, with two low
  lateral folds. The dentition is I&nbsp;4/3 C&nbsp;1/1 Pm&nbsp;3/2 M&nbsp;4/4. This Marsupial
  is nocturnal, and burrowing in habit. Its food consists of insects.<a
  name="NtA_87" href="#Nt_87"><sup>[87]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Myrmecobius</i> is so different from the last-described genera
  (<span class="sc">Dasyurinae</span>) that it is usually separated from
  them as a sub-family <span class="sc">Myrmecobiinae</span>. The animal is
  of a bright rufous colour, banded posteriorly with white. There is no
  hallux, though the metatarsal belonging to that digit is present. There
  are four mammae.<a name="NtA_88" href="#Nt_88"><sup>[88]</sup></a> On the
  chest is a naked patch of some extent, upon which open the ducts of a
  complex gland, which has been described and figured by myself.<a
  name="NtA_89" href="#Nt_89"><sup>[89]</sup></a> There is no pouch, but a
  tract of skin shows indications of a pouch-like structure. The teeth are
  extraordinarily numerous, fifty to fifty-four; the formula being I&nbsp;4/3(4)
  C&nbsp;1/1 Pm&nbsp;3/3 M&nbsp;5/6. Their resemblance to those of certain Jurassic
  Marsupials is dealt with on p. <a href="#page100">100</a>.<a
  name="NtA_90" href="#Nt_90"><sup>[90]</sup></a> In this matter lies of
  <!-- Page 155 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  which may be "an unmodified survivor from Mesozoic times, and therefore
  from a time long before the Didelphyidae, Peramelidae, and Dasyuridae
  were differentiated one from the other." Another ancient feature (found
  in Jurassic mammals) is a mylo-hyoid groove upon the lower jaw, which,
  however, is not always present, and its existence has therefore been
  denied. The single species, <i>M. fasciatus</i>, is partly arboreal and
  partly terrestrial in habit, and feeds upon ants. It is a Western and
  Southern Australian form.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Didelphys</i> contains most of the forms belonging to
  this family, including as it does some twenty-three species. The Opossums
  are mainly arboreal animals, insectivorous in their food; but the larger
  species eat reptiles, birds, and their eggs. Several of the small species
  carry their young, when able to leave the teats, on <!-- Page 156
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page156"></a>{156}</span>their back,
  the tails of the young being wrapped round that of the mother. It is not
  only the pouched species which carry their young in something of this
  fashion. Azara's Opossum, an animal as big as a cat, is said to carry its
  eleven young ones (themselves as large as rats) on the back, though their
  foothold does not appear to be strengthened by intertwining the tails.
  Even with this huge family on her back, the mother can climb trees with
  considerable alacrity. The mammae are seven to twenty-five in number. The
  genus has been lately split up into a number of genera, <i>Marmosa</i>,
  <i>Dromiciops</i>, <i>Peramys</i>, etc.</p>

  webbed hind-feet, and is aquatic in habit. The one species of the genus

  bound up in a common integument, which is not the case with the
  Diprotodont <i>Caenolestes</i>. The hind-feet are longer than the front;
  of the former limb, two or three of the fingers alone are long and
  functional; the others are rudimentary or absent. Tail long, hairy, and

  <p>The genus <i>Peragale</i>, the Rabbit-Bandicoots, consists of two
  species entirely Australian in range. The enormous ears (whence "Rabbit"
  Bandicoot) distinguish this genus from <i>Perameles</i>. The pouch opens
  backwards, and there are eight mammae. <i>P. lagotis</i>, the only

  soil, whence it extracts grubs; it is also a grass-feeder, and it is said
  that its likeness to a Rabbit in appearance is strengthened by its
  similarity in flavour!</p>

  <p><i>Perameles</i> is a genus consisting of twelve species, which are
  found in Tasmania, Australia, and New Guinea. Like the last genus, from
  which it does not widely differ in other points, <i>Perameles</i>

  <p>The last genus of this family is <i>Choeropus</i>, containing but one
  species, <i>Ch. castanotis</i>. It is confined to the Australian
  continent. It is to be distinguished from the last two by the fact that
  there are only two functional digits, the second and third, in the
  fore-limb; the fourth is rudimentary; the other two are absent. It
  burrows, and is omnivorous like its allies. The two metacarpals that are
  developed are very long and closely apposed; they have hence a remarkably
  pig-like aspect, and justify its name. The pouch opens backwards, and
  there are eight mammae.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Notoryctidae.</b>&mdash;This family contains but a single
  genus and species, the recently-discovered <i>Notoryctes typhlops</i>.<a

<p><!-- Page 159 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page159"></a>{159}</span></p>

  <p>We may regard as family-characters the pentadactyle limbs, the
  existence of three pairs of incisors in the lower and four in the upper
  jaw; and the tritubercular nature of the upper molars. <i>Notoryctes
  typhlops</i>, the "Marsupial Mole" as it has been termed, was originally
  discovered by Professor Stirling in Central South Australia. It is a
  burrowing creature, clothed in a silky fur of a pale golden red, without
  external ears. It has been compared in appearance with
  <i>Chrysochloris</i>, the Cape Golden Mole, and the eminent
  palaeontologist, Professor Cope, has even insisted upon a real genetic
  affinity. Edentate affinities have also been suggested. But
  <i>Notoryctes</i> has a small pouch opening backwards as in other
  Polyprotodonts,<a name="NtA_92" href="#Nt_92"><sup>[92]</sup></a> and as
  it also possesses marsupial bones it must undoubtedly be referred to the
  Marsupialia. The animal shows many curious adaptations to its underground
  mode of life. Certain of the vertebrae in the neck and in the lumbar
  region are firmly welded together, giving of course a strength of push,
  and suggesting the Armadillos; the claws of the third and fourth
  front-toes are greatly enlarged, and must be efficient digging organs.
  The track of the animal is like that of a railway in mountainous country;
  it burrows for a short distance, emerges, and then descending beneath the
  surface re-emerges. The red colour of the fur is said to be in harmony
  with the arid soil in which it lives. The native name of the creature is
  "Urquamata." It feeds upon ants and other insects.</p>

  <p><b>Extinct Polyprotodonts.</b>&mdash;Of extinct Polyprotodonts (apart
  from those Mesozoic forms which are considered on p. <a
  href="#page100">100</a>) extinct species of <i>Thylacinus</i> and
  <i>Dasyurus</i> are known from <!-- Page 160 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page160"></a>{160}</span>Australia. The most interesting fact in
  connexion with the Tertiary Polyprotodonts is the existence in South
  America of such genera as <i>Prothylacinus</i> and
  <i>Amphiproviverra</i>, which are not merely Polyprotodonts but
  definitely Dasyures, and not referable to the Didelphyidae.</p>

  <p>These forms have been included in an order, <span
  class="sc">Sparassodonta</span>. But it is not by any means certain
  whether these forms are rightly placed in the neighbourhood of the
  carnivorous Marsupials; it is possible that they ought to be relegated to
  the Creodonta or to their allies. Their structure is in fact somewhat
  intermediate between those two groups. The teeth seem to be carnivorous
  and Marsupial-like in form; but as already mentioned, in connexion with
  the general structure of teeth, more than a single premolar is replaced.
  These animals in fact, in so far as regards their teeth, are midway
  between the Marsupials and the typical Eutheria. The angle of the lower
  jaw is inflected, but the palate is not marked by deficient ossification.
  At least this is not the case with all the members of the group. Whether
  the small <i>Microbiotherium</i>, which is made the type of a family, is
  rightly referred here is not certain. This animal had palatine vacuities
  as well as an inflected angle to the lower jaw.</p>

<h5 class="lg150">CHAPTER VIII</h5>

<h6>EDENTATA&mdash;GANODONTA</h6>

<h5><b>Order II. EDENTATA</b></h5>

  <p>Terrestrial, partly subterranean, or arboreal creatures of quite small
  to gigantic size (some extinct genera), with frequently a covering of
  scales or bony scutes. Limbs clawed. Teeth either totally absent or, if
  present, imperfect in structure, being without enamel, and not forming a
  complete series; incisors and canines being as a rule absent. Teats
  axillary, pectoral, or inguinal.<a name="NtA_93"
  href="#Nt_93"><sup>[93]</sup></a> Retia mirabilia very common in the
  extremities.</p>

  <p>To this group the name of Bruta was given by Linnaeus, but then it
  included not only the families which we now place in the modern order
  Edentata, but also the Elephant and the genus <i>Trichechus</i>. Mr.
  Thomas has proposed to change the name into Paratheria, which name is
  suggestive of what he and some others think concerning the systematic
  position of the group, <i>i.e.</i> that it is not to be placed in the
  Eutherian group of mammals at all, but represents a separate twig which
  has arisen with the Eutheria from a low mammalian stock. This view can
  hardly be accepted if the Ganodonta&mdash;which will be treated of
  presently&mdash;be really ancestral Edentates, for they are not in any
  way a Prototherian mammalian group, so far as their remains enable us to
  judge.</p>

  <p>The Edentata contain the Sloths, Ant-bears, Armadillos, <i>Manis</i>
  and <i>Orycteropus</i>, among living forms. The great Ground-Sloths,
  <i>Megatherium</i>, etc., and Armadillos, <i>Glyptodon</i>, etc.,
  represent the extinct forms.</p>

  <p>The name that has been applied to this group is inappropriate <!--
  Page 162 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page162"></a>{162}</span>inasmuch as many Edentates have teeth. It
  is, however, by a number of small tooth-characters that the order can be
  defined. Thus if teeth are present they are simple in structure, without
  enamel in the adult condition, though a rudimentary enamel-organ has been
  discovered in an Armadillo. The teeth, moreover, are not found in the
  anterior part of the mouth, and they grow from persistent pulps; neither
  is there much differentiation among them. It is not possible, however, to
  speak of the Edentates as quite homodont, since in <i>Orycteropus</i>
  there are large cheek-teeth; but there is at any rate not a marked
  heterodonty in that or in any other Edentate. It used to be said that the
  Edentates were monophyodont. But the Armadillo <i>Tatusia</i> was
  subsequently found to possess a second suppressed dentition, and after
  this discovery Mr. Thomas proved that <i>Orycteropus</i> is also
  diphyodont. Since then other Armadillos have been shown to be diphyodont;
  and the whole group therefore, so far as concerns those members that have
  teeth, may in all probability be regarded as typically mammalian in this
  respect.</p>

  <p>These characters are slender enough, but there seem to be no others by
  means of which the members of this order can be satisfactorily linked
  together. The fact is, that we have here a polymorphic order which
  contains in all probability representatives of at least two separate
  orders. We have at present a very few, and these perhaps highly modified,
  descendants of a large and diverse group of mammals. For convenience'
  sake they will be all treated of under the head of Edentata.</p>

  <p>Although for the probable reasons already stated it is a hard matter
  to frame such a definition as will include all existing Edentates, it is
  easy enough to define two groups in this heterogeneous order; to define
  one group we should say, rather, and then to regard the leavings as
  forming another not so easily definable a group.</p>

  <p>The perfectly-definable group is that which includes the American
  Anteaters, the Armadillos, and the Sloths. In all these creatures, which
  may certainly be regarded as representing on their own account as many
  family types, there are a number of important and highly-characteristic
  anatomical features which they share in common. So exceedingly different
  are these three types in general appearance and (correlated with that) in
  way of life that these common characters acquire increased importance.

  <p>The first of these characters is the series of additional zygapophyses
  on the posterior dorsal and lumbar vertebrae; these are very clear in the
  Anteaters and Armadillos; less clear, but still obviously represented, in
  the Sloths. In the second place, they all possess a clavicle,
  rudimentary, it is true, in the Great Ant-bear, but still present.
  Thirdly, the testes are abdominal throughout life, a character which they
  share with such lowly-organised animals as the Monotremata and the
  Whales. Finally, and this is by no means a matter to be overlooked, not
  only are all the existing members of this group American in range, but
  there is no evidence to prove that they have ever existed elsewhere. No
  European or Old-World <!-- Page 164 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  discovered which can be referred to the Anteater, Armadillo, or Sloth
  type with certainty.<a name="NtA_94"
  href="#Nt_94"><sup>[94]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Of these American forms, which will be treated of first, the
  Armadillos are further apart from either Sloths or Anteaters than the
  last two are from each other. The name <span class="sc">Xenarthra</span>
  has been suggested for the American Edentates with "abnormal" vertebral
  articulations; the corresponding <span class="sc">Nomarthra</span>
  includes the Old-World forms.</p>

  <p>Between the Sloths and Anteaters the extinct <i>Megatherium</i> and
  some of its allies are to a certain extent intermediate. But it may be
  pointed out in the first place that there are certain important
  resemblances between the living forms. In both, retia mirabilia are
  developed in the tail (in spite of its reduction in the Sloths) and in
  the limbs. But, as is well known, retia are also found in other mammals
  far removed in the series from these under consideration. The
  reproductive organs generally are very similar, and they have both a
  dome-shaped and deciduate placenta. The latter character they share with
  the Armadillos and with the Aard Vark; <i>Manis</i> having a
  non-deciduate placenta which is, like that of the Carnivora, zonary in
  form. The Edentates, at any rate the American forms, have a double vena
  cava posterior and no azygos vein. This condition is also met with among
  Whales.</p>

  <p>Osteologically the Sloths and Anteaters are united by the fact that
  the coracoid becomes fused with the coracoid border of the scapula, thus
  forming a foramen; the importance of this character is, however,
  discounted by its occurrence in three genera of Cebidae.</p>

  <p>The above facts embody the views of Sir William Flower.<a
  name="NtA_95" href="#Nt_95"><sup>[95]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 165 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page165"></a>{165}</span></p>

  <p>A subsequent study of the brain and of the muscles of these animals
  has led to results not entirely in harmony with these views.</p>

  <p>Dr. Elliot Smith is of opinion,<a name="NtA_96"
  href="#Nt_96"><sup>[96]</sup></a> after an exhaustive study of the
  Edentate brain, that in this region of the body the present group shows
  very decided points of likeness to the Carnivora; that is, so far as
  concerns the Anteaters. On the other hand, <i>Orycteropus</i> is as
  distinctly comparable with a primitive Ungulate type, such as is
  exemplified by <i>Moschus</i>. "If the brain of <i>Orycteropus</i>," he
  remarks, "were given to an anatomist acquainted with all the other
  variations of the mammalian type of brain, there is probably only one
  feature which would lead him to hesitate in describing it as an
  exceedingly simple Ungulate brain. That one feature is the high degree of
  macrosmatism.<a name="NtA_97" href="#Nt_97"><sup>[97]</sup></a>
  <i>Manis</i>, on the other hand, does not come especially near to
  <i>Orycteropus</i>. The brain of <i>Manis</i> conforms to a simple type
  of architecture, which agrees in many points with both those of
  <i>Orycteropus</i> and the American Edentates; there is not sufficient
  evidence to show which type it really favours." Elliot Smith would, in
  fact, agree with Max Weber that it is better, if a division is to be
  made, to divide the group into three orders<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span>the Xenarthra (Sloths, Anteaters, and
  Armadillos), Tubulidentata (<i>Orycteropus</i>), and Squamata
  (<i>Manis</i>), instead of into Xenarthra and Nomarthra.</p>

  <p>Messrs. Windle and Parsons<a name="NtA_98"
  href="#Nt_98"><sup>[98]</sup></a> are disposed to see in muscular
  similarities reasons for uniting <i>Manis</i> with the American
  Edentates, though they confess to being unable to place
  <i>Orycteropus</i>; in this animal, they say, "we are more struck by the
  generalised mammalian arrangement of its muscles than by any special
  Edentate characters. There are, however, two muscles in
  <i>Orycteropus</i> which show peculiarities not found elsewhere than in
  the Edentates";&mdash;the triceps, which has more than one scapular head,
  and the tibialis posticus, which is double. They conclude that
  <i>Orycteropus</i> "presents some feeble claims to be taken into the
  order."</p>

  <p>We shall here adopt the following divisions. <!-- Page 166 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page166"></a>{166}</span></p>

<h5><span class="sc">Sub-Order 1.</span> XENARTHRA.</h5>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Myrmecophagidae.</b>&mdash;The family Myrmecophagidae
  contains three genera, all South American in range. These genera,
  <i>Myrmecophaga</i>, <i>Tamandua</i>, and <i>Cycloturus</i>, agree
  greatly in their outward form. They are all without teeth, and have long
  snouts and long protrusible tongues. The fur is thick, and they have
  powerful claws wherewith to break down the strong ant-hills upon whose
  inhabitants they feed. <i>Tamandua</i> and <i>Cycloturus</i> are
  arboreal, <i>Myrmecophaga</i> is terrestrial in habit. The claws of the
  arboreal forms are useful to destroy the bark, and thus bring to light
  insects which lurk in such situations.</p>

<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 91.&mdash;Great Anteater. <i>Myrmecophaga jubata.</i> × <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">10</span>.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Myrmecophaga</i> contains but one species, the Great
  Anteater, <i>Myrmecophaga jubata</i>. It is a large and handsome animal,
  with long, shaggy, greyish-black hair and a broad white stripe across the
  shoulder. The coloration is similar in the two sexes. Including the long
  and bushy tail it reaches a length of over 7 feet. It is on account of
  its long tongue and greatly developed salivary glands that this and the
  allied genera were originally placed with <i>Manis</i>. It is the
  submaxillary glands which are so enormous; they extend back over the
  chest, and open by three distinct ducts, of which two unite just before
  the external orifice. <!-- Page 167 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page167"></a>{167}</span>Along their course these ducts are
  provided with a sphincter muscle, which squeezes the secretion towards
  the external orifice into the mouth-cavity. The stomach is somewhat
  gizzard-like. The intestine has no caecum.<a name="NtA_99"
  href="#Nt_99"><sup>[99]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The Anteater's great claws are not only serviceable in tearing up the
  ground to get at its food; armed with them he does not fear, as Mr.
  Waterton remarked, "the fatal pressure of the serpent's fold or the teeth
  of the famished jaguar." An Anteater, too, is more than a match for a big
  dog, and will rip open its belly with the claws while the dog is vainly
  trying to make an impression with its teeth upon the shaggy hair.</p>

  <p><i>Tamandua</i> is a smaller animal than <i>Myrmecophaga</i>, and, as
  has been stated, is arboreal; associated with this habit is a prehensile
  tail. Like the last genus, <i>Tamandua</i> has a rudimentary clavicle,
  this bone being well developed in the little <i>Cycloturus</i>.</p>

  <p>The skull of the Anteater<a name="NtA_100"
  href="#Nt_100"><sup>[100]</sup></a> is very long and low; the fore-part
  is tubular, and there appear to be no traces of teeth. The premaxilla is
  very small; the zygomatic arch is imperfect, and does not reach the
  squamosal behind. A curious feature of this genus, which it shares with
  some Dolphins and other Whales, is that the pterygoid bones develop
  palatine plates which meet each other in the middle line, and thus shift
  the opening of the <!-- Page 168 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page168"></a>{168}</span>posterior nares backwards. This is also,
  of course, a character of various lower vertebrates. Another Whale-like
  character in the skull is the weak character of the mandible, which does
  not give off a marked coronoid process. But then in neither group is
  there much mastication. The tympanic, periotic and squamosal are
  ankylosed together. A peculiarity of the cervical vertebrae is that (as
  in the Camels) the vertebrarterial canal of several of the vertebrae
  perforates the pedicle obliquely. There are fifteen or sixteen dorsal and
  three or two lumbar vertebrae. The additional zygapophyses upon the
  former have been already referred to. The mode of articulation of the
  ribs is highly singular.</p>

  <p>Each segment of the sternum (of which there are eight) is separated
  from the next by a synovial membrane: and it has on either side two
  facets for articulation with the ribs. The way in <!-- Page 169 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page169"></a>{169}</span>which these latter
  bones are connected with the sternum is curiously like their mode of
  connexion with the spinal column at their other end. With this may be
  possibly compared the double articulation of the single rib (which
  articulates with the sternum) in the Rorquals. In <i>Cycloturus</i> this
  mode of articulation does not occur.</p>

  <p>The manus of <i>Myrmecophaga</i> is five-fingered. Of these the third
  digit (as in Perissodactyles) is the most prominent; it is at least
  double the width of the second or third finger; the pollex is very
  slender. In the little <i>Cycloturus</i> this is carried to a greater
  extent: the third digit is relatively enormous; the first and the fourth
  have become quite rudimentary; while the fifth is only just recognisable
  as a minute ossification.</p>

  Spider-monkeys.</p>

  <p><i>Cycloturus</i> is by far the smallest of the Anteaters. It has <!--
  Page 170 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page170"></a>{170}</span>only
  two toes on the fore-feet. It is to be distinguished, anatomically, from
  its larger relatives by the complete clavicle, and by the fact that the
  pterygoids do not meet in the middle line of the skull. The ribs, too,
  are unusually wide, as in the Whale <i>Neobalaena</i>, and form a bony
  encasement for the body. It has two small caeca. Of fossil Anteaters but
  little is known. The most interesting form is <i>Scotaeops</i>,
  interesting because it has two small back teeth, which are totally lost
  in its living allies. The huge Patagonian extinct bird
  <i>Phororhacos</i>, first known by a lower jaw, was at one time regarded
  as a member of this group on account of the form and edentulous character
  of the jaw.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Bradypodidae.</b>&mdash;The Sloths, genera <i>Bradypus</i>
  and <i>Choloepus</i>, come, as already stated, very near to the
  Anteaters, in spite of their striking difference in appearance. The
  Sloths are purely arboreal creatures, with strong recurved claws, which
  serve as hooks to keep them suspended from the lower side of a branch.
  The three-toed sloth, <i>Bradypus</i> (or "Ai"), has the exceptional
  number of nine cervical vertebrae; the two-toed sloth, <i>Choloepus
  hoffmanni</i> (or "Unau"), has the equally exceptional number of six. The
  hair is long and shaggy, and gets an adventitious green colour from the
  presence of minute algae.<a name="NtA_101"
  href="#Nt_101"><sup>[101]</sup></a> This gives to the animal the
  appearance of a lichen-covered bough, a resemblance which is increased in
  one species by an oval mark upon the back, which suggests forcibly a
  broken end of such a branch. The likeness of a Sloth to its surroundings
  is pointed out by Dr. Siemann,<a name="NtA_102"
  href="#Nt_102"><sup>[102]</sup></a> who observed that a species occurring
  in Nicaragua "has almost exactly the same greyish-green colour as
  <i>Tillandsia usneoides</i>, the so-called 'Vegetable Horsehair' common
  in the district.... If it could be shown that it frequented trees covered
  with that plant ... there would be a curious case of mimicry between the
  sloth's hair and the <i>Tillandsia</i>, and a good reason why so few of
  these Sloths are seen." The stomach in the Sloths is complicated in
  structure, with several chambers; one of these gives off a long
  crescent-shaped caecum. The skull of the Sloths agrees in a number of
  particulars with that of the Anteaters. <!-- Page 172 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page172"></a>{172}</span></p>

  </div>
<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 98.&mdash;Skeleton of Three-toed Sloth. <i>Bradypus tridactylus.</i> (After de Blainville.)</p>

  <p>The zygoma is incomplete, though the part connected with the frontal
  has a strong downward process like that found in <i>Diprotodon</i> and
  some other mammals. There is, moreover, a process from the squamosal,
  though it does not reach the anterior part and thus <!-- Page 173
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page173"></a>{173}</span>complete the
  arcade. The premaxillaries are very small, and are usually lost in dried
  skulls. Coupled with these points of likeness are some differences. The
  lower jaw, for instance, has a well-marked coronoid process. The
  pterygoids do not meet in the middle line. The teeth are five or four in
  each half of each jaw. There is no trace of a second set.</p>

  <p>A peculiarity of the Sloths is the enormous number of dorsal
  vertebrae. There are twenty-three of these in <i>Choloepus hoffmanni</i>,
  but only fifteen to seventeen in the Three-toed Sloth, <i>Bradypus</i>.
  As in other American Edentates, the acromion joins the coracoid. This
  connexion occurs in both the Two-toed and the Three-toed species. The
  limbs of these creatures are very long, a concomitant of an arboreal
  life. The femur has no third trochanter. The genus <i>Bradypus</i>, which
  by reason of the fact that it has not lost the third toe on the manus
  seems to be more primitive than <i>Choloepus</i>, shows another
  structural feature which does not bear out this conclusion. The trapezoid
  and the os magnum of the carpus are united, while in <i>Choloepus</i>
  they are perfectly distinct bones.</p>

  <p>The intestine has no caecum.</p>

  <p>There are several species of Sloths. Eminently perfect though the
  organisation of the Sloth in relation to its particular surroundings
  appears to us, Buffon selected the animal as the very type of
  imperfection in nature. "One more defect," he wrote, "they could not have
  existed."</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Dasypodidae.</b>&mdash;The family Dasypodidae or Armadillos
  contains a considerable number of genera. <i>Tatusia</i>,
  <i>Tolypeutes</i>, <i>Dasypus</i>, <i>Xenurus</i>, <i>Priodon</i>,<a
  name="NtA_103" href="#Nt_103"><sup>[103]</sup></a> and
  <i>Chlamydophorus</i>. They have all a more or less rigid covering of
  bony plates imbedded in the skin, which are not in the least comparable
  with the scales of the Manis. Save the Whales, in one or two genera of
  which traces of a dermal armature exist, the Armadillos are unique among
  existing mammals in this particular. The term "Edentate" is especially
  inapplicable to the Armadillos; the genus <i>Priodon</i> may have more
  than forty teeth in each jaw; a total of ninety was found in one specimen
  examined by Professor Kükenthal. In the tendency of the teeth to
  multiply, we have another example of a state of affairs which
  characterises so many Whales. Generally, however, seven to nine is the
  number of teeth in each <!-- Page 174 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page174"></a>{174}</span>half jaw, of which one is often implanted
  in the premaxilla. The Armadillos show their alliance with the other
  American Edentates in the points enumerated above. Their teeth specially
  ally them to the Sloths, while the salivary and digestive organs
  generally are on the Anteater plan, but present a less extreme
  development. There are, however, caeca, paired as in birds, in the genera
  <i>Dasypus</i> and <i>Chlamydophorus</i>. The others have none. But there
  is a dilatation at the commencement of the large intestine, which is not
  very different from the slightly-developed caeca of <i>Dasypus</i>.</p>

  <p>There are certain peculiarities in the skeleton, which distinguish
  this family.</p>

  <p>The skull in the Armadillos presents a number of likenesses to the
  other American Edentates.<a name="NtA_104"
  href="#Nt_104"><sup>[104]</sup></a> The premaxillaries are small, but are
  larger in <i>Dasypus</i> than in <i>Tatusia</i>. On the other hand the
  lachrymals are larger in the latter. The zygomatic arch is complete, but
  there is no downward process as in the Sloths. In <i>Tatusia</i> (but not
  in <i>Dasypus</i>) the "short thick pterygoids add somewhat to the hard
  palate." This is clearly a beginning or a remnant of the quite
  crocodilian character of the palate of <i>Myrmecophaga</i>. In the
  cervical vertebrae we see the Whale-like character of fusion between
  individual vertebrae; and also, as in the Whales, the degree to which
  this fusion is carried out varies; two to four may be thus united. The
  additional articular facets upon the dorsal vertebrae have been already
  commented upon as a point of important likeness to other American
  Edentates. The dorsal vertebrae are commonly eleven in number, the lumbar
  being three. But in <i>Priodon</i> the numbers are twelve and two
  respectively. There are traces to be observed of the double-headed
  attachment of the ribs to the sternum. The shoulder girdle of the
  Armadillos is somewhat diverse in form in different genera; the acromion
  is always large, and is remarkable in <i>Priodon</i> for the fact that
  the humerus also articulates with it, its extremity being recurved, and
  forming a socket for this purpose. As in some other Edentates there is a
  second spine on the scapula behind the first. The clavicle is strong.
  There is some variation in the form of the manus. It is five-fingered in
  <i>Dasypus</i>; in <i>Tolypeutes</i> the first digit has vanished; on the
  other hand, in <i>Priodon</i>, the fifth has become rudimentary <!-- Page
  176 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page176"></a>{176}</span>and the
  third enormously enlarged. This latter fact recalls the arrangement
  characteristic of <i>Myrmecophaga</i>. The pelvis is greatly attached by
  the ischium to the vertebral column. The femur has a third
  trochanter.</p>

  <p>The various forms of Armadillos are largely distinguished by the
  number of movable thin bands of scutes lying between the large anterior
  and posterior shields. Thus we have <i>Dasypus sexcinctus</i>,
  <i>Tolypeutes tricinctus</i>, etc.</p>

  <p>The little Pichi-chago (or, more correctly, Pichy-ciego),
  <i>Chlamydophorus</i>, which only grows to about 5 inches in length, has
  no movable bands at all. It is covered with a uniform series of plates,
  which, moreover, are not discontinuous at the neck. It differs, too, from
  the prevailing Armadillo-type by the absence of conspicuous external
  ears. In the anterior part of the body the armature consists of little
  more than the horny plates, which in other Armadillos overlie the bony
  dermal plates. In the hinder region the bony plates are strong. In this
  animal, therefore, we have the dermal armature reduced to a minimum; but
  it must be noticed that, like the extinct Glyptodons, the armature is
  continuous and nowhere ringed.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Tolypeutes</i>, of which the best-known species is <i>T.
  tricinctus</i>, the Apar (there are two other species in the genus), can
  roll itself up into a ball like the Pill-Millipede (<i>Glomeris</i>),
  and, protected by its armour, roll away from its enemies like the
  Arthropod under similar circumstances. This mode of protection, be it
  observed, is also adopted by the Pangolin and by the <!-- Page 177
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page177"></a>{177}</span>Hedgehog. The
  genus has only three movable bands. The tail is short, and is covered
  with large tubercles. This genus is very markedly digitigrade when
  running.</p>

<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 104.&mdash;Peludo Armadillo. <i>Dasypus sexcinctus.</i> × ¼. (After Vogt and Specht.)</p>

  <p>The Peludo, <i>Dasypus sexcinctus</i>, is, like other Armadillos, an
  omnivorous creature, and appears to be particularly fond of carrion. It
  will burrow up to a decaying carcase like the ground-beetles. <!-- Page
  178 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page178"></a>{178}</span>Mr. W. H.
  Hudson has described the way in which this Armadillo will kill a snake by
  holding it down and literally sawing the reptile in half by help of the
  sharp and serrated edges of the carapace. <i>Dasypus</i> has a very short
  tail, which is shielded by distinct rings near the base.</p>

  <p><i>Tatusia novemcincta</i> is a species with nine movable bands. The
  genus has four teats; the ears are near together. There are no caeca and
  no azygos lobe to the lung. A species apparently belonging to this genus,
  but described under the generic names of <i>Cryptophractus</i> and
  <i>Praopus</i>, is remarkable for the thick covering of hair, not
  entirely wanting but usually thin in other Armadillos. In this particular
  species the coat of hair is so thick as to conceal the underlying plates
  of the carapace. The individual hairs are stiff, and one inch and a half
  in length.<a name="NtA_105" href="#Nt_105"><sup>[105]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The genus <i>Xenurus</i> contains several species, the best known of
  which is inaptly named <i>X. unicinctus</i>. As a matter of fact the
  characteristic feature of the genus is the existence of twelve or
  thirteen movable plates between the two ends of the body. <i>X.
  unicinctus</i> has twelve dorsal and three lumbar vertebrae. This
  Armadillo, known by the vernacular name of the Cabassou, has one of the
  most modified hands that are found in the family. The first two digits
  are slender and elongated; but are quite normal in the number of their
  phalanges. In the remaining three digits the metacarpal is short and
  broad, while the proximal phalanx is either suppressed altogether or
  fused with the metacarpal, the middle phalanx is present but short, while
  the third phalanx is very large indeed. As in <i>Dasypus</i>, but not as
  in <i>Tatusia</i>, which is in so many other respects divergent from
  these genera, the lungs have an azygos lobe. As a small point of
  difference, tending to show an alliance between the genera <i>Xenurus</i>
  and <i>Dasypus</i> and their difference from <i>Tatusia</i>, is the
  deeply-imbedded gall-bladder; this sac is not nearly so deeply plunged
  into the hepatic tissue in <i>Tatusia</i>. <i>Xenurus</i> has no caecal
  dilatations. The brain "is intermediate in its form and surface markings
  between <i>Dasypus</i> and <i>Tolypeutes</i>." The small intestine is
  nearly eighteen times the length of the large. But these intestinal
  measurements are not of much avail in this group as marks of affinity,
  since in three species of <i>Dasypus</i> Garrod gives the following
  widely-divergent lengths<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span><i>D.
  villosus</i>, 11.5 feet and 1.25; <i>D. minutus</i> <!-- Page 179
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page179"></a>{179}</span>5.1, with a
  large intestine of no less than 7 feet; <i>D. vellerosus</i> 4.3 and
  .66.</p>

  <p><i>Priodon</i> is the giant of its race. This Armadillo may reach a
  length of 3 feet to the base of the tail. The tail is some 20 inches
  long. The large number of teeth has been already noticed. There are
  twelve or thirteen bands. Other points in the structure of this genus
  have already been mentioned, and need not be recapitulated. This
  Armadillo feeds upon termites and carrion.</p>

  <p><i>Scleropleura</i> is unfortunately but imperfectly known. The single
  species, named by Milne-Edwards<a name="NtA_106"
  href="#Nt_106"><sup>[106]</sup></a> <i>S. bruneti</i>, is apparently a
  very rare inhabitant of Brazil. It is known by a single skin, which was
  tanned by the hunter who obtained it. Thus the hair, if any, has dropped
  out. The plates in the skin are deficient along the back and even upon
  the top of the head, and are barely represented upon the tail
  posteriorly. The ears are small and distant from each other. The tail is
  longish, about one-third of the length of the body. The total length of
  the creature including the tail is rather more than a foot and a half.
  The hunter who obtained it regarded it as a hybrid between an Armadillo
  and an Anteater.</p>

  <p><b>Extinct Xenarthra.</b>&mdash;There are a good many extinct forms of
  Armadillo, apart of course from the Glyptodons. <i>Peltephilus</i> is
  referred to later (p. <a href="#page186">186</a>). <i>Dasypus</i> was
  represented by a large form, 6 feet long, with a skull of one foot in
  length. The genus <i>Eutatus</i> was also large. The carapace was formed
  of thirty-three distinct bands, of which the last twelve are soldered
  together, but not fused into a shield as in <i>Dasypus</i>, etc.</p>

  <p>An extinct group of American Edentates, termed the <span
  class="sc">Gravigrada</span>,<a name="NtA_107"
  href="#Nt_107"><sup>[107]</sup></a> are somewhat intermediate between the
  Sloths and the Anteaters. A number of the genera are well known from
  complete skeletons.</p>

  <p>One of the typical forms of this group is <i>Mylodon</i>, which,
  together with its immediate allies, is often placed in a separate family,
  <b>Mylodontidae</b>.</p>

  <p><i>Mylodon</i> itself was a large creature, as big as a Rhinoceros. It
  was covered externally by armour in the skin, which did not form a
  massive armature as in the Glyptodonts, but was in the <!-- Page 180
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page180"></a>{180}</span>form of
  scattered plates, small and not fused together. The general aspect of the
  skull is decidedly Sloth-like. As in that animal, the malar bone is bifid
  posteriorly, and between the bifurcation is embraced the process of the
  squamosal. This latter is thus more developed than in the Sloth, but
  there is no actual union between it and the malar. The premaxilla is
  small. The lower jaw has both coronoid and ascending processes, and is
  massive. There are five teeth on each side above, and four on each side
  below, as in the Sloths. There are the normal seven cervical vertebrae
  and sixteen dorsals. The limbs are not long and slender,but short and
  strong, the animal having been terrestrial. The fore-feet were five-toed,
  of which the three inner toes had claws. The hind-feet were only
  four-toed, and the two inner only were clawed.</p>

  </div>
<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 105.&mdash;<i>Mylodon robustus.</i> (Restoration, after Owen.)</p>

  <p><i>Scelidotherium</i> is a genus which is a trifle smaller than the
  last. It has only four properly-developed toes in the fore-foot, the
  thumb being rudimentary; of these, the first two bear claws. The
  hind-feet are also four-toed. Like <i>Mylodon</i>, <i>Scelidotherium</i>
  is a Pleistocene genus.</p>

  <p><i>Glossotherium</i> has a skull very much like the last two genera;
  but it is remarkable for the fact that the nostrils instead of being
  unprotected with bone anteriorly are there closed by a plate of bone
  formed by the well-developed premaxillae, the nostrils appearing at the
  sides, and giving the skull a curious likeness to that of a Chelonian.
  From a series of recent and most important observations it appears to be
  clear that this genus has survived into quite modern times.<a

  <p>The well-known naturalist of La Plata, Señor Moreno, engaged in
  studies connected with the political boundary line between Chili and the
  Argentine, had occasion to visit Consuelo Cove on Last Hope Inlet in
  Patagonia. Hanging from a tree he noticed a piece of dried skin, which at
  once struck him as looking more like the remains of a Mylodon than of any
  living animal. The inhabitants regarded this piece of skin as a great
  curiosity, but were of opinion that it was the hide of a cow encrusted
  with <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'peebles'"
  >pebbles</span>! This fragment from a bygone age was originally described
  by Professor Ameghino, who had apparently seen some of the bonelets
  imbedded in it, as <i>Neomylodon listai</i>, "a living representative of
  the ancient Gravigrade Edentates of Argentina." That this piece of skin
  is of quite recent date seems to be proved by a number of considerations.
  In the first place it is covered by long hair of a light yellowish-brown
  colour; it does not seem likely that hair would preserve its character
  for geological epochs. The nearest corresponding case is that of the
  remains of Moas in New Zealand, whose feathers, dried skin, and tendons
  are known. Now the Moa was unquestionably contemporaneous with man, as
  abundant surviving legends prove, and indeed it cannot have been long
  extinct. Still, hair is a resisting structure, and in a dry cave, with no
  possibility of irruptions of floods, might retain its characters for long
  periods. The evidence, however, of more recent date is stronger than
  this. The skin shows patches of reddish colour, suggestive of course of
  blood-stains. A small piece of the outside of the skin at the cut edge,
  which presented the appearance of freshly or comparatively freshly dried
  fluid, was submitted to a chemical examination and shown to be serum! Dr.
  Lönnberg examined chemically a bit of the skin itself and found in it,
  after boiling, glue, "which proves that the collagen and gelatinous
  substances are perfectly preserved." After this it seems impossible to
  suppose that the skin can be of any very great age; for bacteria would
  have finished their work upon the serum and gelatine long ago. Combined
  with the fresh appearance of the skin is the very fresh appearance of the
  skull. In fact it is impossible to believe that the animal was not alive
  quite a few years since, relatively speaking. It is admitted that this
  animal was contemporaneous with man. There are actually legends of a
  creature which may have been this <i>Glossotherium</i>. "Ancient
  chroniclers inform us that the indigenous inhabitants recorded the
  existence of a <!-- Page 182 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page182"></a>{182}</span>strange, huge, ugly monster, which had its
  abode in the Cordillera to the south of latitude 37. The Tehuelches and
  the Gennakens have mentioned similar animals to me, of whose existence
  their ancestors had transmitted the remembrance; and in the neighbourhood
  of Rio Negro, the aged Cacique Sinchel, in 1875, pointed out to me a
  cave, the supposed lair of one of these monsters, called 'Ellengassen';
  but I must add that none of the many Indians with whom I have conversed
  in Patagonia have ever referred to the actual existence of animals to
  which we can attribute the skin in question."</p>

  <p>A rude painting in a cavern, in red ochre, seems to Dr. Moreno (whose
  words we have just quoted) to be somewhat suggestive of a
  <i>Glyptodon</i>. There are some reasons for believing that this
  quadruped was kept by man as a domestic creature. In the cave are two
  walls of rough pieces of stone which seem to have dropped down owing to
  the wearing away of the roof; they also seem to have been loosely piled
  together to form two walls, within which enclosure an imperfect skull of
  the animal was found. This skull shows clearly that the so-called
  "<i>Neomylodon</i>" must be referred to <i>Glossotherium</i> or
  <i>Grypotherium</i>, as it is sometimes termed. This skull is perforated
  on the roof in such a way as could only have been effected (in the
  opinion of experts) by a weapon in the hand of a man. A hole in the skin
  has been even compared to a bullet-wound. But this it is perhaps
  unnecessary to discuss. The skin of <i>Glossotherium</i> is, like that of
  other extinct "Ground-sloths" (<i>e.g. Mylodon</i>), filled with small
  and irregular ossicles. But in <i>Mylodon</i>, the sculptured appearance
  of the dermal ossicles appears to indicate that they reached the surface
  of the body and were covered by epidermis alone, which is not the case
  with the animal now under consideration. The microscopic characters of
  the ossicles, too, show differences in the two. <i>Glossotherium</i>
  being "precisely intermediate between <i>Mylodon</i> and the existing
  Armadillo (<i>Dasypus</i>)." Now <i>Glossotherium</i> and <i>Mylodon</i>
  are regarded as forms which lie between the existing Anteaters and the
  Sloths of the same part of the world. We have already pointed out the
  facts of structure which lead to this conclusion. It might therefore be
  reasonably surmised that the hair of <i>Glossotherium</i> would be also
  intermediate, or at least like that of one of the two genera
  <i>Myrmecophaga</i> and <i>Bradypus</i>. But microscopical investigation
  has <!-- Page 183 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page183"></a>{183}</span>negatived this supposition. It has shown
  that the Armadillos are in this matter the nearest relatives of
  <i>Glossotherium</i>. This result is important as tending further to
  confirm the close interrelationship of all the American Edentates as
  contrasted with the Old-World forms&mdash;a matter which has already been
  emphasised. It is suggested, however, that the absence of under fur,
  which is so well developed in the Sloth, and the difference shown in
  transverse sections from the hair of <i>Myrmecophaga</i>, may be
  explained by difference in habitat. <i>Glossotherium</i> lived under
  conditions similar to those under which the Armadillos live to-day. Thus
  the outer covering of the body became alike in the two cases, the same
  needs supervening in both genera.</p>

  <p><i>Lestodon</i> is another allied genus, which seems to possess
  canines. At any rate, in front of the four molars, and separated from
  them by a diastema, is a smallish, somewhat canine-like tooth, in both
  jaws.</p>

  <p><i>Megalonyx</i> and its allies are sometimes placed in a distinct
  family, <b>Megalonychidae</b>. <i>Megalonyx</i> itself had a skull very
  like that of <i>Bradypus</i>, being shorter and not so elongated as in
  the Mylodontidae. There is a strong tusk anteriorly, which is separated
  by a considerable space from the three molars lying behind it. Both pairs
  of limbs seem to have possessed five toes. This is a North American
  genus. It differs from the bulk of the American Edentates in having a
  complete jugal arch.</p>

  <p><i>Megatherium</i> is the type of yet a third family,
  <b>Megatheriidae</b>, of the Gravigrade Edentates. This creature is
  familiar from the many restorations which have been built up, and from
  its huge bulk, little short of that of an elephant. The skull, which is
  small for the size of the creature, has a complete jugal arch, from the
  middle of which depends a downward process as in other allied forms. The
  teeth grow to an extraordinary depth, and there are five of them in the
  upper and four in the lower jaw&mdash;on each side of course. The
  fore-limbs of the <i>Megatherium</i> are very much more slender than the
  enormously bulky hind-limbs, upon which and the equally massive tail the
  animal seems to have supported itself while tearing down branches of
  trees, upon whose leaves it fed. In the scapula the acromion joins the
  coracoid as in <i>Bradypus</i>; the clavicle is large. The fore-limb is
  four-toed, and the hind-limb three-toed. The latter has but one clawed
  digit (the third, <i>i.e.</i> the inner). <!-- Page 184 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page184"></a>{184}</span>On the manus, the three
  inner digits have powerful claws. This animal, too, was Pleistocene in
  time. The Megatheriidae had, however, small as well as gigantic
  forms.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Zamicrus</i> had a skull no bigger than that of a Sloth,
  while <i>Nothrotherium</i> was also a comparatively small creature; the
  teeth of the latter genus are reduced to 4/3.</p>

  <p>The extinct group of the <b>Glyptodontidae</b> comprises large
  creatures with a dense covering of bony scutes which are arranged in a
  tesselated fashion, and thus form an immobile armature of immense
  strength. In correspondence with this massive carapace the dorsal
  vertebrae have fused together, and the lumbar vertebrae form a series
  ankylosed to each other and to the following sacrals. These creatures are
  all South American.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:47%;">
      <a href="images/106.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/106.png"

<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 106.&mdash;<i>Glyptodon clavipes.</i> × <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">12</span>. (After Owen.)</p>

  <p><i>Glyptodon</i>, the genus which gives its name to the family, is
  known from numerous remains in South America, and also from so far north
  as Texas and Mexico. It grew to be as long as 16 or 17 feet. In the skull
  there is an exceedingly long downward process of the zygomatic arch, as
  in Sloths, the arch itself being complete. The process extends so far
  down as to reach a point about on a level with the middle of the lower
  jaw. The nasals are short or rudimentary. As in <i>Myrmecophaga</i>, the
  pterygoids enter into the formation of the bony palate. The lower jaw has
  a spout-shaped extremity, and, behind, it rises into an enormous vertical
  branch as high as the front part of the jaw is long. There are eight
  teeth in each half of each jaw. As in <!-- Page 185 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page185"></a>{185}</span>some Armadillos, the
  cervical vertebrae are at least partly fused. The atlas is free, but the
  rest, or at any rate five of them, are united. The last cervical is
  sometimes fused with the succeeding dorsals; the latter are twelve in
  number, and are fused together so far as concerns their centra and neural
  processes. The succeeding region of the vertebral column includes seven
  to nine lumbars, which are fused with the eight sacrals; in this region
  the neural processes are high, and there is thus produced a strong and
  lofty ridge along the back, which forms a powerful support for the
  carapace. The fore-limbs are shorter than the hind-limbs, which latter
  are attached to an <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'unusally'"
  >unusually</span> massive pelvis. The claws of the limbs are blunt and
  almost hoof-like.</p>

  <p>The heavy carapace consists of sculptured, five or six-sided plates,
  which have no particular arrangement in the middle, but towards the
  margins show indications of an arrangement in transverse rows. The
  moderately long tail is also encircled by bony skin-plates which are
  thorny above, or at least provided each with a blunt upstanding process.
  It appears that outside this bony system of scutes were horny epidermic
  scales, corresponding exactly with the tesserae which they cover. There
  are apparently a good many species of <i>Glyptodon</i>.</p>

  <p>In the allied genus <i>Panochthus</i> the tail is rather longer, and
  the bony rings which surround it, instead of being all movable as in
  <i>Glyptodon</i>, are at first so, but later, <i>i.e.</i> towards the end
  of the tail, become welded into a single and massive piece. Both feet are
  here four-toed, while in <i>Glyptodon</i> the hind-feet are five-toed and
  the fore-feet four-toed.</p>

  <p><i>Daedicurus</i> shows a further specialisation, in that the feet
  have three and four digits respectively. The orbit too shows a
  specialisation in being separated from the temporal fossa. The descending
  process of the zygomatic arch is not so extraordinarily exaggerated as it
  is in <i>Glyptodon</i>. It has the same terminal tube of osseous scutes
  upon the tail. This creature seems to have reached a length of about
  twelve feet.</p>

  <p><i>Propalaeohoplophorus</i> is, unlike the great Armadillos that we
  have hitherto dealt with, a small animal, not exceeding 2 feet or so in
  length of carapace. A small alveolus on each side of the premaxillae
  seems to suggest the former presence of an incisor tooth; and it seems
  that the animal possesses both true molars and premolars; for the first
  four of the eight teeth are much <!-- Page 186 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page186"></a>{186}</span>simpler in structure
  than those which follow. The dorsal vertebrae again are not fused
  together; the hind-limbs are five-toed. All the plates of the carapace
  are arranged in definite transverse rows; it has been observed, too, that
  some of the anterior scutes overlap like those of the Armadillos, to
  which this animal possesses further likenesses in the exclusion of the
  maxillae from the border of the nostril (a Glyptodont character), and the
  comparative feebleness of the scutes.</p>

  <p>A primitive genus also appears to be <i>Peltephilus</i>, which is
  perhaps rather an Armadillo than a <i>Glyptodon</i>. However, it comes
  somewhat between the two, like <i>Propalaeohoplophorus</i>, with which it
  may therefore be treated. A most singular feature of this genus has been
  mentioned on p. <a href="#page27">27</a> in connexion with the skull in
  the Mammalia generally. That is the fact that a portion of the squamosal
  surrounding the articular facet for the lower jaw is separated by a
  suture from the rest of that bone, and is therefore obviously suggestive
  of the quadrate in the lower Vertebrates. As in certain Armadillos and
  Glyptodons, etc., the pterygoids appear in this genus to have taken a
  share in the formation of the hard palate. The plates of the carapace
  were movable, as is shown by the fact that they sometimes slightly
  overlap. In view of the possible origin of the Edentates from
  lowly-organised Mammalia, it is noteworthy that the humerus has been
  especially compared to that of the Monotreme. <i>Peltephilus</i> differs
  from other Armadillos in having teeth in the front of the jaws. The total
  number of teeth is twenty-eight, <i>i.e.</i> seven in each half of each
  jaw.</p>

<h5><span class="sc">Sub-Order 2.</span> NOMARTHRA.</h5>

  <p>As already explained, the Old-World Edentates differ from the
  New-World forms in having normal dorsal vertebrae, that is to say,
  without additional zygapophyses. That negative feature, however, though
  combined with the positive fact that both the Old-World forms feed upon
  ants, is hardly sufficient to outweigh the many structural differences
  which distinguish the Orycteropodidae from the Manidae; which will be
  placed therefore in different groups. To that containing the Aard Vark,
  the name <span class="sc">Tubulidentata</span> may be applied. <!-- Page
  187 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page187"></a>{187}</span></p>

  <p>This group contains but one family, the <b>Orycteropodidae</b>, of
  which there is but a single genus.</p>

  <p>The Aard Vark (earth-pig), genus <i>Orycteropus</i>, is characterised
  by its heavy build, the body being covered by rather coarse and not very
  abundant hair; the snout is long and pig-like, with round nostrils at its
  end; the ears are long, erect, and pointed; the tail is very thick at
  first, so that it has been aptly described as "a tapering of the body to
  a point." The fore-limbs are four-toed, the hind five-toed.</p>

  <p>In the skull there is a complete though slender zygoma; the
  premaxillaries, though small, are not so rudimentary as in the American
  Edentates. The annular tympanic is not ankylosed to the surrounding
  bones, a character found in other low mammals. Contrary to what is found
  in <i>Manis</i>, <i>Orycteropus</i> has a huge lachrymal. There are
  thirteen dorsal and seven lumbar vertebrae. The clavicle is well
  developed. <i>Orycteropus</i> is peculiar among Edentates in that the
  ischia do not unite with the vertebral column. The femur has a third
  trochanter.</p>

  <p>As mentioned on p. <a href="#page162">162</a>, the Aard Vark is
  diphyodont like normal mammals. The permanent teeth consist of five
  molars and premolars on each side of each jaw; the first two of these are
  premolars, and are simpler in their form than the succeeding two teeth,
  which are partly divided by a median furrow into two halves. These teeth
  are also peculiar in that they consist entirely of vaso-dentine. They
  have been compared in minute structure to those of the Ray
  <i>Myliobates</i>. According to Mr. Oldfield <!-- Page 188 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page188"></a>{188}</span>Thomas<a name="NtA_109"
  href="#Nt_109"><sup>[109]</sup></a> there are seven milk teeth on each
  side of the upper jaw (limited to the maxillae, and thus not incisors).
  An eighth tooth was discovered on one side of one of the specimens
  examined by Thomas. In the lower jaw there are only four milk teeth on
  each side. It is interesting to note that the histological structure of
  these milk teeth agrees with that of the permanent teeth. There are two
  species of this genus found in Africa: the southern, <i>O. capensis</i>,
  is more hairy than the northern, <i>O. aethiopicus</i>. <i>O. gaudryi</i>
  is a Pliocene species from the Island of Samos and from Persia, described
  by Dr. Forsyth Major and Dr. Andrews.<a name="NtA_110"

  <i>O. aethiopicus</i>.</p>

  <p>Of the Scaly Anteaters, Group <span class="sc">Squamata</span> or
  <b>Manidae</b>, there is really but one genus, though <i>Phatagin</i>,
  <i>Pholidotus</i>, <i>Smutsia</i>, and <i>Pangolin</i> have been used to
  distinguish various forms. The genus <i>Manis</i> is African and Oriental
  in range. Dr. Jentink, who has lately revised the species, allows
  seven.<a name="NtA_111" href="#Nt_111"><sup>[111]</sup></a> The external
  form of these animals is fairly well known, the remarkable scales
  distinguishing the Pangolins from other animals. Between the scales lie
  hairs, which seem to be absent in the adults of the African species,
  though present in the young, thus affording a convenient method of
  distinguishing the Ethiopian from the Oriental forms. The scales have
  been compared to agglutinated hairs. That they are not "merely mimetic of
  the Lizards' scales" is held by Weber,<a name="NtA_112"
  href="#Nt_112"><sup>[112]</sup></a> who compares them directly with those
  <!-- Page 189 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page189"></a>{189}</span>structures, as he does the scales of other
  mammals, such as those upon the tail of <i>Anomalurus</i>, etc. This,
  however, is not a universal opinion. It is true that these scales occur
  chiefly in the lower forms of mammals such as those under consideration,
  Marsupials, Rodents, and Insectivores; but the fact that the hairs are
  developed before the scales shows, or seems to show, that the former are
  the older structures, and to lead to the inference that the scales of
  mammals are new structures. The scattered hairs of the Pangolin have no
  sebaceous glands excepting on the snout. This, again, looks as if they
  were degenerate structures, and emphasises the non-archaic character of
  the scales. These animals have no trace of teeth except possibly some
  slight epithelial thickenings which have been interpreted as a last
  remnant; the tongue is suited for the capture of ants, and is therefore
  much like that of the not nearly-related American Anteaters. The stomach
  is of simple form; it is characterised by a large gland, which suggests
  that of the Koala (see p. <a href="#page144">144</a>); the intestine has
  no caecum. Retia mirabilia occur on the limb arteries. The placenta is
  non-deciduate and diffuse; it is specially compared by Weber with that of
  the Horse. Considering the many adaptive resemblances between this genus
  and the American Anteaters, especially in the mouth cavity, it is
  remarkable that in <i>Manis</i> the pterygoids are not joined as they are
  in <i>Myrmecophaga</i>. In spite of statements to the contrary, it
  appears that there is sometimes a distinct lachrymal.</p>

  <p>A remarkable feature in the skeleton of <i>Manis</i> is the singular
  sternum. The xiphoid cartilage is extraordinarily elongated into thin
  strips, which reach the pelvis and return. This state of affairs is to be
  found in the African species only. This structure is not comparable, as
  it has been said to be, with abdominal ribs such as those of the reptile
  <i>Hatteria</i>.</p>

  <p>These animals are mainly anteaters. The Japanese have a curious legend
  as to the method adopted for the capture of ants, which is related by Dr.
  Jentink in his monograph of the genus. The Manis "erects his scales and
  feigns to be dead; the ants creep between the erected scales, after which
  the anteater again closes its scales and enters the water; he now again
  erects the scales, the ants are set floating, and are then swallowed by
  the anteaters"! The same story is related by Mr. Stanley Flower on the
  authority of the Malays.</p>

  <p>Though it seems clear that the likenesses which <i>Manis</i> shows
  <!-- Page 190 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page190"></a>{190}</span>to the Anteaters of the New World are
  chiefly adaptive and have nothing to do with real affinity, being merely
  an expression of a similar mode of life, it is curious to note that here
  and there we do find certain resemblances which do not seem to be
  susceptible of the latter explanation. The jugal bone, absent in
  <i>Manis</i>, is small in <i>Myrmecophaga</i>; the clavicle is absent and
  again small or rudimentary in the Anteaters; it is large in other
  Edentates. The third trochanter is absent, as in <i>Myrmecophaga</i> (and
  the Sloths). There are many scales on the body; in <i>Myrmecophaga</i>
  there are traces of these structures on the tail, as also in
  <i>Tamandua</i>. In the features mentioned, the Myrmecophagidae differ
  from either or from both of the two other American families (<i>i.e.</i>
  Dasypodidae, Bradypodidae) and agree with <i>Manis</i>. The facts are not
  a little remarkable.</p>

<h5><b>Order III. GANODONTA.<a name="NtA_113" href="#Nt_113"><sup>[113]</sup></a></b></h5>

  <p>Allied to the Edentata, and apparently representing the ancestral
  forms from which they, at any rate the Xenarthra were derived, is the
  order of the Ganodonta. Of this order a number of genera are now known,
  which can be ranged in a series which more and more approaches the
  Edentata as we pass from the older to the newer forms. This interesting
  and transitional series will be made manifest by a description of the
  characters of the various genera taken in their proper <!-- Page 191
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page191"></a>{191}</span>chronological
  order. The following genera are included by Wortman in his family
  <b>Stylinodontidae</b>.</p>

  <p>The earliest type of the Ganodonta is the genus <i>Hemiganus</i>, with
  but one species, <i>H. otariidens</i>. This animal lived during the
  deposition of the lowest Eocene strata, the Puerco beds of North America.
  It was about as big as a fair-sized Dog, and had powerful jaws. There
  were at least two pairs of incisors in the upper jaw, together with
  powerful canines and the full premolar and molar formula. In the lower
  jaw the canines were also strong, but the incisors are not certainly
  known to be more than two pairs. The enamel upon the posterior surface of
  the canine is thin, and in the case of the incisors the enamel seems to
  be limited to the anterior face. The lower molars are quadritubercular.
  It is believed from the presence of a suture on the upper surface of the
  premaxillary that the snout of the creature was tubular. The cervical
  vertebrae, only known by their centra, are like those of the Armadillos
  (and for the matter of that of the Whales) in the great transverse as
  opposed to the antero-posterior diameter. The feet are especially
  compared with those of the Ground Sloths. The single ungual phalanx is
  marked by a large subungual process, which is pierced by a considerable
  foramen. The tibia again is to be compared with that of the
  Armadillos.</p>

  <p>In the Upper Puerco (Torrejon) beds the remains of
  <i>Psittacotherium</i> are found. This genus, when first discovered, was
  referred to the Tillodontia by some and to the Ungulates, the latter
  being a refuge for indeterminate Eocene mammals, just as the
  "Multituberculata" is for similarly-placed Secondary mammals. It is now
  known to be clearly a member of the order Ganodonta. Wortman thinks that
  there is but one species, <i>P. multifragum</i>. It seems to have had a
  general aspect much like that of <i>Hemiganus</i>&mdash;that is judging
  from the skull&mdash;and was not very greatly different in size. The
  facial portion of the skull is short, and the zygoma is deep. The
  infra-orbital canal is double, a feature which crops up in the Sloth, and
  has been mentioned in the later form of Ground Sloth, <i>Megalonyx</i>
  (but it must be remembered that the same characteristic is not unknown in
  Rodents). The dentition is reduced as compared with that of
  <i>Hemiganus</i>, that is to say, as far as concerns the molars and the
  incisors. There is but a single pair of incisors in each jaw; the canines
  are strong; the premolar and molar series seem to have been complete in
  the lower jaw, <!-- Page 192 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page192"></a>{192}</span>but reduced by one premolar at least in
  the upper jaw. It is very important to notice that the incisors have
  enamel only on their anterior faces, and that the same is the case with
  the canines, the slender layer present behind the tooth in
  <i>Hemiganus</i> having vanished in this later form. The tooth pattern of
  the molars is like that of <i>Hemiganus</i>. The fore-limb is decidedly
  Edentate-like; but it is the foot which presents the strongest likenesses
  to that order. "If an anatomist," remarks Dr. Wortman, "had no other part
  of the skeleton than that of the foot to guide his judgment, and he
  should fail to detect a most striking similarity between it and that of
  the Edentata, especially the Ground Sloths, he would not only lay himself
  open to the criticism of being lacking in the ordinary powers of
  observation and comparison, but would be suspected of placing the matter
  upon a basis other than that established by such a method." It is not
  certain how many toes upon the fore-limbs were possessed by
  <i>Psittacotherium</i>, but the close resemblance to <i>Mylodon</i> is
  indeed striking, the third digit being in both forms the most pronounced.
  Some vertebrae of this Ganodont have been discovered which do not show
  the complex articular arrangements of later American Edentates. The
  sacrum, on the other hand, is very like that of the Sloth, and there is a
  foreshadowing of the attachment of the ilia to the sacrum by
  co-ossification which is met with in later Edentates. A still later type
  is the genus <i>Calamodon</i>, which has been shown to occur in Europe as
  well as in America. <i>C. simplex</i> was a larger beast than either of
  the genera that have already been treated of, thus affording another
  example of the increase in size of later as compared with earlier members
  of the same group, so pronounced among the Ungulata. The lower jaw has
  the same massive structure that characterises that bone in
  <i>Hemiganus</i> and <i>Psittacotherium</i>. There is but one incisor,
  but the premolar and molar series are complete. The canine is Rodent-like
  in appearance, being imbedded throughout the greater part of the lower
  jaw; it evidently grew from a persistent pulp. It is enamelled upon the
  anterior face only. The premolar and molar teeth are in this genus
  commencing to lose their enamel, which is distributed in the form of
  vertical bands, leaving interspaces which are not covered by enamel.
  These teeth, moreover, are decidedly hypselodont, more decidedly so than
  in <i>Psittacotherium</i>; they are, when unworn, quadricuspidate, with
  accessory cusps; when more worn, the teeth <!-- Page 193 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page193"></a>{193}</span>are double-ridged, and
  that transversely to the long axis of the jaw; finally, the much-worn
  teeth have flattish crowns more or less surrounded by a ring of
  enamel.</p>

  <p>A still later form, coming from the Lower and Middle Eocene strata, is
  the genus <i>Stylinodon</i>. <i>S. cylindrifer</i>, which is the more
  archaic of the two described species, is only known from a single molar,
  fragments of a canine, and "some inconsiderable pieces of the skull." The
  molar is interesting on account of the fact that the enamel is still
  further reduced; it is represented only by narrow vertical strips, which
  are much narrower than those of older forms of Ganodonts. It is also
  hypselodont, and has a persistent pulp. So, too, the canine which had a
  thick anterior facing of enamel. The later species, <i>S. mirus</i>, is
  more fully known. The teeth seem to have been much the same as in the
  last-described species; the premolars and molars were seven in all in the
  lower jaw, and the canine was imbedded in the bone for a long distance,
  as in <i>Calamodon</i>. The cervical vertebrae have short centra as in
  <i>Hemiganus</i>. The clavicles were well developed. The humerus
  possessed an entepicondylar foramen, and its head displays the pyriform
  pattern so characteristic of later Edentates. The foot is clearly like
  that of <i>Psittacotherium</i>.</p>

  <p>In reviewing the series, therefore, we see a gradual diminution of the
  incisors, a gradual loss of enamel on the teeth generally, and the
  production of hypselodont teeth growing from persistent pulps; all of
  which are features of the later Edentates. The progression is so gradual
  that the forms enumerated and described seem to have been part of a
  continuous series culminating in the Ground Sloths of later times. The
  other points of similarity will be gathered from the facts given in the
  foregoing pages.</p>

  <p>There is another family belonging to the Ganodonta whose position with
  regard to the Edentata is not so clear. This is the family
  <b>Conoryctidae</b>, of which two genera are known. The earliest of
  these, from the Lower Puerco, is <i>Onychodectes</i>. In <i>O.
  tissonensis</i> the skull is long and narrow, thus contrasting with that
  of the last family. The facial part is also long. The lower jaw is much
  more slender. The molar formula was complete, but there is some doubt as
  to the incisors. The molars are tritubercular.</p>

  <p>The other known genus is <i>Conoryctes</i>. Its skull has a shorter
  <!-- Page 194 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page194"></a>{194}</span>facial portion, and is thus more like that
  of Stylinodontidae than that of <i>Onychodectes</i>. The dental formula
  is known, and is complete save for the loss of one incisor above and
  below, and one premolar above. The relationship of these Ganodonts to any
  later forms is uncertain; but their skeletal structure is as yet by no
  means fully known.</p>

<h6>UNGULATA&mdash;CONDYLARTHRA&mdash;AMBLYPODA&mdash;ANCYLOPODA&mdash;TYPOTHERIA&mdash;TOXODONTIA&mdash;PROBOSCIDEA&mdash;HYRACOIDEA</h6>

<h5><b>Order IV. UNGULATA</b></h5>

  <p>The existing members of this order can be readily grouped into the
  Hyracoidea, Proboscidea, Perissodactyla, and Artiodactyla, each of which
  divisions has quite the value of an order, and all of which are sharply
  marked off from each other. But as the discovery of so many fossil forms
  has to a great extent rendered these demarcations less sharp, it is
  better to regard all these groups as not more than sub-orders of a larger
  "Order" Ungulata. Even when this conclusion has been necessarily arrived
  at from a consideration of the more ancient groups of Ungulate animals,
  the definition of such an order remains a difficult matter for the
  systematist. For the earliest of these forms, more particularly the
  Ancylopoda, the Amblypoda, and the Condylarthra, whose peculiarities will
  be dealt with at length subsequently, are not by any means easily
  differentiated from the primitive Carnivorous mammals of that date, the
  Creodonta; these latter, moreover, fade into the Marsupials through the
  so-called Sparassodonta of Professor Ameghino. To confine ourselves to
  the Ungulates, we may perhaps define them as terrestrial animals with
  hoofs rather than claws or nails, and chiefly, if not entirely,
  vegetarian in habit. The teeth are bunodont or lophodont, the tendency to
  the production of the latter type being always marked. The walk, although
  plantigrade in the older types, becomes more and more digitigrade, except
  in such survivals from antiquity as <i>Hyrax</i>. There is, too, as we
  pass from the ancient types to the modern, a gradual perfection of the
  limbs as running <!-- Page 196 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page196"></a>{196}</span>and not climbing or grasping organs; the
  number of toes becomes reduced, and culminates twice (in the horse and in
  the Litopterna) in one toe on each foot; at the same time the ulna
  becomes rudimentary and fuses with the radius, and the fibula in the
  hind-limb undergoes a like reduction. The clavicle is absent even in some
  of the oldest types; its presence in <i>Typotherium</i><a name="NtA_114"
  href="#Nt_114"><sup>[114]</sup></a> is highly remarkable. The tail too,
  an organ which is long in some of the early forms, gets short in their
  modern derivatives.</p>

  <p>Coupled with the increasing perfection of the foot as an organ used
  merely for the support of the body, certain interesting changes have
  taken place in the arrangement with regard to each other of the several
  bonelets of the wrist and ankle. It has been held by Cope and others that
  the truly primitive disposition of these bones was that presented to us
  by certain early types, such as <i>Meniscotherium</i> or the existing
  elephant or <i>Hyrax</i>. In these animals there is (see Fig. 112) a
  serial <!-- Page 197 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page197"></a>{197}</span>arrangement of these bones, the distal
  bones only, or very nearly only, articulating with the corresponding
  bones in the upper series. In the modern types (cf. Fig. 113) there is,
  on the other hand, an interlocking, so that the bones of the distal
  series articulate with two of those of the proximal series. By this is
  produced, as it would appear, a much firmer foot, less liable to "give"
  under pressure, and thus more fitted for an animal that runs. It is the
  same principle as that adopted in the laying of bricks. The actual stress
  and strain of impact has been held responsible for those changes. An
  equally ingenious and possibly truer explanation of the undoubted facts
  has lately been advanced by Mr. W. D. <!-- Page 198 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page198"></a>{198}</span>Matthew.<a
  name="NtA_115" href="#Nt_115"><sup>[115]</sup></a> He has pointed out
  that in some ancient Ungulates the carpus is not serial but interlocking,
  even in forms which belong to the earliest Eocene groups, such as the
  genus <i>Protolambda</i> among the Amblypoda. Now in the fore-foot of
  <i>Meniscotherium</i> and the living <i>Hyrax</i> there is a separate
  centrale which is wanting in the greater number of Ungulates. The
  absorption, that is the practical dropping out of this bone, would
  restore to an interlocking carpus the serial arrangement; while on the
  other hand, by the fusion of this bone with the scaphoid, the
  interlocking disposition would be maintained.</p>

  <p>The gradual perfecting of the fore- and hind-limbs as running organs
  has been put down to the advent of the grasses, and the formation of
  large plains covered with this herbage. The same reason would also be in
  harmony with the equally gradual change in the shape of the molar teeth,
  from a tubercular form calculated for a mixed or even a carnivorous diet,
  to the flatter crushing surfaces exhibited by the lophodont teeth of
  later Ungulates. Strong <!-- Page 199 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page199"></a>{199}</span>canines would in the same way cease to be
  useful, and even become encumbrances to such grazing creatures; and their
  disappearance is one of the salient features in the history of the
  Ungulata, that is of the modern representatives of the order. The
  extraordinary hypertrophy of these teeth in such a line as that of the
  Amblypoda, which has left no descendants, was one of the reasons perhaps
  for the decay of those great pachyderms of mid-Tertiary times; their
  excessive armature became an encumbrance, since it was not accompanied by
  improvements in other necessary directions. Some of the features of the
  Tertiary Ungulates have, however, been dealt with in our general sketch
  of the mammalian life during that epoch, and need not be again referred
  to here. Of existing Ungulates there are no clear indications of the
  descent of the Elephants or of the Hyracoidea. Their structure proclaims
  these two divisions to be of ancient descent, and not to be modern twigs
  of the Ungulate stem. As to the Perissodactyla and the Artiodactyla we
  cannot bring them together nearer than in quite early Tertiary times. The
  order Condylarthra seems to be the starting-point of both these
  sub-divisions. <i>Euprotogonia</i> has been considered to be an ancestor
  of the Perissodactyle branch, and <i>Protogonodon</i> or
  <i>Protoselene</i> of the Artiodactyla. If this be true, <!-- Page 200
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page200"></a>{200}</span>the likenesses
  which <i>Titanotherium</i> shows to the Artiodactyla must be either
  purely superficial and secondary, or a cropping out of ancient characters
  which had been dormant for many generations.</p>

  <p><b>Horns.</b>&mdash;The Ungulata are the only order of mammals which
  possess horns; as they are on the whole a more defenceless group than the
  Carnivora, it may be that the horns are a counterpoise to the teeth and
  claws of the latter; need for defence and for armature in the combats
  with their own kind for the favours of the does has led to a different
  kind of protective and aggressive mechanism. Horns as weapons are,
  however, particularly effective in this group wherever they exist. A
  Ruminant is most frequently a large and heavy animal without the agility
  and litheness of the Carnivore. It is precisely to this sort of animal,
  where weight is an important consideration, that horns are the most
  suitable weapons. This is further shown by the fact that although the
  general term horn is used to describe the weapons of the Ungulate
  mammals, there is more than one kind of structure included under this
  general term; it is indeed probable that the extreme terms in the series
  of horns have been independently acquired by their possessors. There is
  but little in common between the horns of a Giraffe and of a Rhinoceros.
  In the Rhinoceros we have one or two horns, in the latter case one placed
  behind the other, which are purely epidermic growths; they may indeed be
  regarded as matted masses of hair, borne, it is true, upon a boss of
  bone, which however is not a separate structure. The Giraffe supplies us
  with the simplest term in that series of horns which are partly epidermal
  and partly bony. The paired horns of this animal have often been
  contrasted with those of the Deer, for example; but there is no
  fundamental difference between them. In the Giraffe a pair of bony
  outgrowths, originally separate from the skull which bears them, but
  ultimately ankylosed to it, are covered by a layer of entirely unmodified
  skin. A distinction of undoubtedly practical importance is usually drawn
  between the Hollow-horned Ruminants, <i>i.e.</i> Oxen, Goats and
  Antelopes, and the Deer tribe. There is nevertheless no fundamental
  distinction. In the Antelopes there is a core of bone, the "os cornu" as
  it has been termed, which is covered by a horny layer, the horn proper,
  variously modified in shape and size according to the genus or species.
  In the Deer there is the <!-- Page 201 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page201"></a>{201}</span>same os cornu, which may however be
  branched, but which is in the same way covered by a layer of modified
  integument; this is known as the "velvet"; it only lasts for a certain
  period, and is then torn off by the exertions of the animal itself,
  leaving behind the bony core, which is popularly termed the horn. It will
  be clear that here is only a difference of comparative unimportance; the
  same essential features are present in both groups of animals, but the
  modification of the epidermis has progressed along different lines. Both
  can be referred back to the primitive conditions seen in the paired horns
  of the Giraffe. Even the difference, such as it is, is bridged over by
  the Antelope <i>Antilocapra</i>, where the os cornu is bifid and the horn
  is periodically shed, as is the velvet of the stag; but in the stag the
  bony part of the horn is also shed, a state of affairs which has no
  parallel in the Hollow-horned Ruminants. The great <i>Sivatherium</i> may
  conceivably be an annectant form between the two types of compound horns,
  <i>i.e.</i> those of the Antelope and those of the Deer. This creature
  had two pairs of horns, of which, naturally, only the bony cores remain;
  the hinder pair of these were branched. But although so far they resemble
  the Deer's horns rather than the Antelope's, Dr. Murie has thought that
  they were covered by a horny sheath and not by soft skin as in the Deer.
  In any case these horns were apparently never shed, which is a point of
  likeness with the Antelope and of difference from the Deer. Apart
  therefore from the nature of the covering of the bony cores, there are
  good grounds for looking upon them as intermediate between those of the
  Deer and those of the Antelopes.</p>

  <p>The horns of the Ruminants are frequently a secondary sexual
  character; this is especially the case with the Deer. The Reindeer is,
  however, an exception, both the stags and the does having horns. That
  they are associated with the reproductive function is shown by their
  being shed after the period of rut, the destruction of the velvet at that
  period, and also by the effect upon the horns which any injury to the
  reproductive glands produces. Some useful facts upon this latter head
  have been amassed by Dr. G. H. Fowler,<a name="NtA_116"
  href="#Nt_116"><sup>[116]</sup></a> who noticed in a series of stags,
  horns showing various degrees of degeneration in the antlers produced by
  varying degrees and periods of gelding. From the facts <!-- Page 202
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page202"></a>{202}</span>here collected
  it is clear that a direct effect is produced. If we are to regard horns
  as secondary sexual appendages which have been subsequently handed on to
  the female by heredity, we should expect to meet with examples of animals
  now horned in both sexes, of which the earlier representatives had the
  horns confined to one sex. This is most interestingly shown by the
  extinct and Miocene Giraffe, <i>Samotherium</i>, of which the male alone
  had a pair of short horns, while the skull of the female was entirely
  hornless; the modern <i>Giraffa</i>, as is well known, has horns in both
  sexes.</p>

  <p>It is interesting to note that the existing Perissodactyles and
  Artiodactyles are to be distinguished by their unpaired or paired horns.
  But while there are no Artiodactyles with unpaired horns (save occasional
  sports) the Perissodactyles have more than once tried, so to speak,
  paired horns, which ultimately proved fatal to them. The Rhinoceros
  <i>Diceratherium</i> apparently inherited and improved upon the small
  paired horns of <i>Aceratherium</i>, but it has left no descendant. The
  paired horned Titanotheria offer another instance of the same apparent
  incompatibility between the Perissodactyle structure and the persistence
  of paired horns.</p>

<h5><span class="sc">Sub-Order 1.</span> CONDYLARTHRA.</h5>

  <p>This group is characterised by the following assemblage of characters.
  Extinct, often plantigrade Ungulates, with five-toed limbs. Bones of
  carpus and tarsus not always interlocking, but sometimes lying above each
  other in corresponding positions. The humerus has an entepicondylar
  foramen. Dental formula quite complete; the molars brachyodont and
  bunodont. The premolars are simpler than the molars. The canines are
  small. As with other early types, the zygapophyses are flat and do not
  interlock. The astragalus is like that of the Creodonta. This group was
  American and European in range, the remains of its rather numerous genera
  being of Eocene time. The best-known genus is <i>Phenacodus</i>, of which
  some account will be given before discussing the, in many cases, more
  fragmentary remains of other allied forms.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Phenacodus</i> was first described so long ago as 1872,
  from a few scattered teeth. Since then several nearly complete skeletons
  have been obtained, and we are in full possession of <!-- Page 203
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page203"></a>{203}</span>the details of
  its osteology. It was not a large creature (see Fig. 110, p. <a
  href="#page196">196</a>), about 6 feet in length, with a small head. The
  feet were more or less plantigrade, and five-toed. The last phalanges of
  the toes show that they carried hoofs and not claws; yet the fore-feet
  look a little as if they could be used as grasping organs. The third
  digit of both hind- and fore-feet exceeds the others, and thus a
  Perissodactyle-like foot characterised this Eocene creature. The tail is
  exceedingly long, and must have reached the ground as the animal walked.
  This is of course by no means an Ungulate character. Still, in the
  totality of its organisation the animal was decidedly Ungulate, though
  Professor Cope spoke of <i>Phenacodus</i> as not merely an ancestral
  Ungulate but as the parent form of Insectivores, Carnivores, Lemurs,
  Monkeys, and Man himself! The scapula indeed is from its breadth and oval
  contour rather like that of a Carnivore. The clavicles as in other
  Ungulates are absent. The femur is Perissodactyle rather than
  Artiodactyle in the presence of a third trochanter. The creature had
  fifteen pairs of ribs and five or six lumbar vertebrae. The two bones of
  the leg which lie below the femur are perfectly distinct and separate. A
  cast of the brain-case shows that the cerebral hemispheres were smooth
  and small, the cerebellum of course completely uncovered and nearly as
  large as the cerebrum. The olfactory lobes were also large. The complete
  skeleton of <i>Phenacodus</i> has lately been excavated more fully from
  the enveloping matrix by Professor Osborn,<a name="NtA_117"
  href="#Nt_117"><sup>[117]</sup></a> and mounted in what is regarded as
  the natural position of the beast. It appears that though five-toed it
  went upon the three middle toes only, and furthermore that of these the
  middle one was the more prevailing, so that <i>Phenacodus</i> was
  distinctly "Perissodactyle," at least in habit. Moreover its "long
  hind-quarters, the long powerful tail ... are reminiscent of Creodont
  ancestry." The genus was European and American in range.</p>

  <p><i>Meniscotherium</i> ( = <i>Hyracops</i><a name="NtA_118"
  href="#Nt_118"><sup>[118]</sup></a>) comprises several forms of about the
  size of a fox; they are both European and American in range. The teeth
  are more distinctly Ungulate in form than those of <i>Phenacodus</i>,
  with a <img src="images/w.png" class="middle" style="height:2ex;" alt="W"
  />-shaped outer wall. The skull is described as possessing "indifferent,
  primitive characters," permitting a comparison with those of Opossums,
  Insectivores, and <!-- Page 204 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page204"></a>{204}</span>Creodonta. It has, as in
  <i>Phenacodus</i>, no orbital ring. The humerus resembles that of a
  Carnivore rather than that of an Ungulate. The carpus and tarsus are
  serial. The fibula articulates with both the calcaneum and the
  astragalus, which is not the case with <i>Phenacodus</i>. It is suggested
  that these animals are ancestral forms of the Chalicotheres. In the brain
  the hemispheres do not cover the cerebellum.</p>

  <p>More primitive apparently than <i>Phenacodus</i> was the less-known
  genus <i>Euprotogonia</i>, or <i>Protogonia</i><a name="NtA_119"
  href="#Nt_119"><sup>[119]</sup></a> as it has been called. The best-known
  species is <i>E. puercensis</i>, so called from its occurrence in the
  Puerco beds of the American Eocene. It was a slender, long-limbed
  creature, smaller than <i>Phenacodus</i>, with a long and heavy tail as
  in that animal. Like <i>Phenacodus</i> it was semiplantigrade, and shows
  more likenesses to the Creodonta. The skull is only known by a part of
  the lower jaw with teeth, and by the teeth of the upper jaw. The
  vertebrae are not entirely preserved, but enough remain to show that the
  animal had a tail of 16 or 17 inches, which is a considerable length when
  compared to its height, about a foot at the rump. In the fore-limb the
  most noteworthy point is that the ulna has a convex posterior border as
  in the Creodonts, the same border in <i>Phenacodus</i> being concave. The
  humerus is slender, with less-marked tuberosities. The fifth digit seems
  to have been less reduced. The phalanges seem to have borne horny sheaths
  somewhat intermediate between hoofs and claws. The pelvis is described as
  being, as is also that of <i>Phenacodus</i>, rather like that of the
  Creodonta. The right hind-limb is known in all its details. It appears
  that the bones are not serial but interlocking; this, however, on the
  views with regard to the relations of these two forms of tarsus mentioned
  on p. <a href="#page198">198</a>, does not militate against regarding
  <i>Euprotogonia</i> as the ancestor of the genus <i>Phenacodus</i>. The
  third toe is the pre-eminent one, the animal thus being Perissodactyle.
  The lateral digits are larger than in <i>Phenacodus</i>, and the
  metatarsals and the phalanges are slightly curved, which is again a
  Creodont character as compared to the perfectly straight corresponding
  bones of <i>Phenacodus</i>. It seems evident that this animal is to be
  looked upon as a more ancient type than <i>Phenacodus</i>, even if not as
  its actual ancestor.</p>

  <p>Another group of the Condylarthra contains the genus
  <i>Pertipychus</i> and some others. <i>Periptychus</i> has the full
  dentition <!-- Page 205 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page205"></a>{205}</span>of forty-four teeth, the molars being of
  course bunodont, with the three chief tubercles most developed. The bones
  of the tarsus interlock and are not serial, as they are in many other
  members of the Condylarthra. The astragalus has a shorter neck than in
  <i>Meniscotherium</i>, for example. It has in this a likeness to the same
  bone in the Amblypoda, to the primitive members of which, such as
  <i>Pantolambda</i>, this animal bears much resemblance. "Astragali and
  many skeletal bones of <i>Periptychus rhabdodon</i> and <i>Pantolambda
  bathmodon</i> are almost indistinguishable," observes Mr. Matthew. The
  fore-feet of this genus are unknown, but it would seem that it was
  plantigrade from the evidence of the hind-feet. There are several species
  of the genus.</p>

  <p>Possibly, but not at all certainly, the Mioclaenidae, with the genera
  <i>Mioclaenus</i> and <i>Protoselene</i>, are to be referred to this same
  order of primitive Ungulates. It is only necessary to mention them here,
  because they show very clearly the primitive form of dentition of these
  early Eocene mammals. The teeth are quite complete and unbroken by a
  diastema. The canines are but little pronounced. The molars are not
  strictly tritubercular, but have a prevailing trituberculy. The nature of
  the feet is not known. Since the genus <i>Protoselene</i>, as its name
  denotes, shows an indication of a commencing selenodonty, it has been
  suggested that this group is the stock whence the Artiodactyles have been
  derived.</p>

  <p>In any case, whether the particular comparisons that have been made as
  to the relationship of various forms of Condylarthra are valid or not, it
  seems to be plain that this group represents the earliest Ungulate stock,
  but little differentiated from the contemporaneous Creodonts.</p>

<h5><span class="sc">Sub-Order 2.</span> AMBLYPODA.</h5>

  <p>This group of extinct mammals has the following principal
  characteristics<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>They are large, semiplantigrade Ungulates, of heavy build and
  apparently elephantine gait. The dentition is for the most part complete
  as in other ancient groups, and the canines are in the later forms big
  tusks. The back teeth are brachyodont and ridged (lophodont). Both radius
  and ulna in the fore-limb, and tibia and fibula in the hind-limb, are
  well developed. The bones <!-- Page 206 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page206"></a>{206}</span>in the carpus are alternating in position.
  The toes are five in both feet, and are very short. There is a hint of
  commencing "perissodactylism" in the fore-feet at any rate. The brain is
  small and the hemispheres smooth.</p>

  <p>The Amblypoda, or Amblydactyla, are so called on account of their
  short and stumpy feet and toes. They were held by Professor Cope to be on
  the direct line of ancestry of both Perissodactyles and Artiodactyles, a
  view which is on the whole not accepted at present.</p>

<i>m</i>, mastoid; <i>m.f</i>, mastoid foramen. (After Osborn.)</p>

  <p>As is the case with other groups, the Amblypoda commenced existence as
  a sub-order with relatively small forms such as <i>Pantolambda</i>, the
  most ancient type known, which is in many respects a transition between
  the later forms and other groups of mammals such as the Creodonta.<a
  name="NtA_120" href="#Nt_120"><sup>[120]</sup></a> The race culminated
  and ended in the giant <i>Dinoceras</i> and <i>Coryphodon</i>, and spread
  into the Old World. In spite of their smooth and diminutive brain, these
  mammals were able to hold their own and to multiply into many species and
  genera; in this they were perhaps aided by their formidable tusks and by
  the horns which many of them possessed. The teeth seem to imply an
  omnivorous diet, which was quite possibly an additional advantage in the
  struggle for existence. It does not seem to be necessary to divide off
  the Dinoceratidae into a sub-order equivalent to the Coryphodontidae as
  was done <!-- Page 207 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page207"></a>{207}</span>by Professor Marsh; the numerous points in
  common possessed by the members of both families forbid their separation
  more widely than as families.</p>

  <p>The earliest types of Amblypoda belong to the genus
  <i>Pantolambda</i>, of which the species <i>P. bathmodon</i> was about
  four feet in length. As restored it seems to have had proportionately
  short fore- and hind-limbs, and it had a long tail. It was apparently
  plantigrade, and would have had not a little likeness to a carnivorous
  type. The skull has no air cavities, such as are developed in the later
  types from the Lower Eocene, e.g. <i>Coryphodon</i>; <i>Pantolambda</i>
  is from the basal Eocene. The frontal bones show no trace of the horns
  that are developed in subsequent forms; the nasals are comparatively
  long; the zygomatic arch is slender. The molar teeth are in the primitive
  form of trituberculy, and the premolars, as is so often the case with
  primitive animals, are unlike the molars in form, being less markedly
  selenodont. As to the vertebral column, the dorsal vertebrae appear to
  have had short spines, which argues, as it does also in the case of the
  larger and heavier <i>Coryphodon</i>, a feebleness in the development of
  ligaments and muscles supporting and moving the head. The scapula seems
  to have the same peculiar leaf-like form that it has in the later
  <i>Coryphodon</i>.<a name="NtA_121" href="#Nt_121"><sup>[121]</sup></a>
  This primitive type shows an entepicondylar foramen in the humerus. It is
  interesting to observe that the posterior border of the ulna is convex,
  as in the Creodonts, and in the early Condylarthrous form
  <i>Euprotogonia</i>. In the subsequently-developed Amblypoda, as in the
  later Condylarthra, that bone acquires a concave outer border. In the
  carpus the os centrale is distinct. In the femur the third trochanter is
  well formed; it gradually dies out in later Amblypoda. The fibula
  articulates with the calcaneum. This species, according to Osborn,
  "typifies the hypothetical Protungulate, being more primitive than either
  <i>Euprotogonia</i> or <i>Phenacodus</i>."<a name="NtA_122"

  <p>The genus <i>Coryphodon</i> is known by a large number of species, of
  which the first was discovered in this country, and was represented
  merely by a jaw with some teeth. This was named by Sir R. Owen <i>C.
  eocaenus</i>, and was dredged up from the bottom of the sea off the Essex
  coast. A second specimen consisted of a single <!-- Page 209 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page209"></a>{209}</span>canine tooth only, and
  was brought up from a depth of 160 feet during the making of a well at
  Camberwell. More abundant remains have since been found in North
  America.</p>

  <p>This genus had a large head, and in some specimens traces of the "horn
  cores," so marked in the related <i>Dinoceras</i>, are to be noticed. The
  skull is broad behind and narrowed in front; the roofing bones show the
  cellular spaces so characteristic of the Elephant. The jugal bone,
  however, is not, as it is in the Elephant, placed in the middle of the
  somewhat massive zygomatic arch. As in some other primitive Ungulates
  (e.g. <i>Phenacodus</i>) there are twenty dorso-lumbar vertebrae, of
  which fifteen bore ribs.</p>

  <p>The scapula seems to have possessed a peculiar leaf-like form,
  swelling in the middle and ending almost in a point above. It has a
  well-marked spine, and the acromion projects much. The fore- as well as
  the hind-feet are in a state of transition between plantigradism and
  digitigradism. It was at one time held that the animal was digitigrade as
  to the fore-feet and plantigrade as to the hind-feet. Though, as has been
  pointed out, it is a fact that the hind-feet are often on a different
  plane of evolution from the fore-feet, it seems that this amount of
  difference does not characterise any Ungulate, not excepting the genus
  now under consideration.</p>

  <p>The toes are very spreading. The pelvic girdle is of great strength
  and broadness. The femur, as in the Perissodactyles, has a well-developed
  third trochanter; but whereas in this particular the hind-limb is
  Perissodactyle, it is Artiodactyle in the fact that the tibia and the
  fibula articulate with the astragalus and calcaneum. The ridged teeth
  have given the name to the genus.</p>

  <p>A curious feature in the structure of the genus are the slender spines
  of the dorsal vertebrae, which contrast with the enormous ones of some
  other Ungulates&mdash;more curious in this genus, which is of heavy
  build, than in the lighter <i>Pantolambda</i>. The back of the animal is
  short, and the limbs are very spreading, so that the gait was doubtless
  shuffling. The large head, and short and heavy limbs and limb girdles
  added probably to its cumbrous walk or trot. The canines are great tusks,
  and spread out on both sides of the mouth.<a name="NtA_123"
  href="#Nt_123"><sup>[123]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The late Professor Cope, in 1874, described the probable appearance of
  the <i>Coryphodon</i> in the following words<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span>"The general appearance of the Coryphodons, as
  determined by the skeleton <!-- Page 210 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page210"></a>{210}</span>probably resembled the bears more than any
  living animals, with the important exception that in their feet they were
  much like the elephant. To the general proportions of the bears must be
  added the tail of medium length. Whether they were covered with hair or
  not is of course uncertain. Of their nearest living allies, the
  elephants, some were hairy and others naked.... The movements of the
  Coryphodons doubtless resembled those of the elephant in its shuffling
  and ambling gait, and may have been even more awkward from the
  inflexibility of the ankle."</p>

  <p>The most recent members of this sub-order come from the Middle Eocene
  beds, and are chiefly referable to the genus <i>Dinoceras</i>, with which
  <i>Tinoceras</i> and <i>Uintatherium</i> are at least very nearly
  related, if not identical. These creatures were of great size, larger
  than the earlier types which have been considered. They show a certain
  superficial resemblance to the Titanotheriidae, on account of the massive
  horn cores upon the skull. These horn cores are large upon the maxillae
  and the parietals, and are paired; on the nasals are smaller horns. The
  bones of the skull have air cavities. The incisors of the upper jaw are
  absent; the canines are enormous tusks, and the lower jaws are flanged
  downwards near the symphysis where these tusks border them. Contrary to
  what is found in the older types, where the position of the condyle of
  the lower jaw is normal, this prominence faces backwards in the
  Dinocerata. The same shortness of the spines of the dorsal vertebrae
  prevails in this group as in the other Amblypoda, though it is perhaps
  hardly so marked. The scapula has not the peculiar acuminate form that
  exists in <i>Coryphodon</i>, but is triangular and broad above. The limbs
  are elephantine, in that the angle between the humerus and the femur
  respectively, and the bones which follow, is not marked. The hind-limbs
  are especially straight. The tail is short as compared with that of the
  primitive Amblypoda. The Dinocerata are purely digitigrade. The
  entepicondylar foramen has, as in the Coryphodonts, disappeared. The os
  centrale of the carpus has become fused, and no longer exists as a
  separate bone. The fibula no longer articulates with the calcaneum, but
  both that bone and the ulna are well developed. The genus
  <i>Astrapotherium</i> is placed among the Amblypoda by some
  authorities.<a name="NtA_124" href="#Nt_124"><sup>[124]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The history of the discovery of the members of this order is very
  instructive as illustrating the dangers of laying too much classificatory
  importance upon detached fragments of animals. So long ago as 1825
  terminal phalanges of a new creature were found in the Miocene of
  Eppelsheim, and sent to Cuvier. Cuvier named them "Pangolin gigantesque,"
  deeming them, on account of their general form and cleft terminations, to
  pertain to the Edentata. In the same bed some seven years later were
  found certain teeth clearly of an Ungulate character, to which the
  generic name of <i>Chalicotherium</i> was applied. It was subsequently
  discovered that the teeth and the claws belonged to the same animal, and,
  later, further remains turned up which disclosed a creature having the
  anomalous composition of an Ungulate with decisively Ungulate teeth, but
  with the feet to a large extent like those of an unguiculate animal. The
  same confusion of characters occurs also, it will be remembered, in the
  distinctly Artiodactyle <i>Agriochoerus</i> (see p. <a
  href="#page331">331</a>). Indeed the feet of the latter when first
  discovered were erroneously, as it now appears, referred to the present
  order of Ungulates under the name of <i>Artionyx</i>. It is probable that
  the genus <i>Moropus</i> of North America is a member of this group, and
  that it is probably congeneric with a somewhat different type of
  Ancylopod known as <i>Macrotherium</i>. It is also clear that
  <i>Anisodon</i>, <i>Schizotherium</i>, and <i>Ancylotherium</i>, if not
  congeneric with either of the two recognised genera, are at least very
  close to them.</p>

  <p><i>Chalicotherium</i> has a skull which recalls that of some of the
  earlier Ungulates; it has, however, no incisors at all, and no canines in
  the upper jaw; this feature has led to the belief that the animal is
  related to the Edentata, and that it is in fact a link between them and
  the Ungulata. The molars, like those of the Perissodactyla, are of the
  buno-selenodont type. It also agrees with that group (to which it has
  been approximated by several writers) in the. tridactyl manus and pes,
  and in the characters of the tarsus. But although tridactyl, the axis of
  the limb passes through the fourth digit. <i>Chalicotherium</i> is not
  mesaxonic, as are the Perissodactyles. Moreover, it has no third <!--
  Page 212 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page212"></a>{212}</span>trochanter, and the unguiculate claws have
  already been referred to. As to the latter, which are short, it is not
  the end phalanx but the first which is retracted; thus
  <i>Chalicotherium</i> differs markedly from both Carnivorous and Edentate
  types; for in the former it is the last phalanx which is retracted, while
  in the Edentates the same phalanx is flexed downwards. The limbs of
  <i>Chalicotherium</i> are nearly of the same size, and the animal seems
  to have been stout and quadrupedal.<a name="NtA_125"
  href="#Nt_125"><sup>[125]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Macrotherium</i>, like the last genus, seems to have been common to
  both New and Old Worlds. It is to be distinguished by a number of
  characters. It is supposed to have been "semi-arboreal and fossorial";
  the fore-limbs are much longer than the hind, the relative proportions of
  the radius and tibia being 70 to 29. The ulna was distinct from the
  radius, whereas in <i>Chalicotherium</i> the two are coalesced, or nearly
  so. Young specimens appear to possess a full set of incisors; whether
  this is the case or not with <i>Chalicotherium</i> is not known.<a
  name="NtA_126" href="#Nt_126"><sup>[126]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Homalodontotherium</i> is sometimes placed in the group.</p>

<h5><span class="sc">Sub-Order 4.</span> TYPOTHERIA.</h5>

  <p>It is a little difficult to be confident that the Typotheria are
  rightly referred to the Ungulata, since they contradict two important
  Ungulate rules. They have clavicles, which are elsewhere missing, and the
  thumb looks as if it were opposable.<a name="NtA_127"
  href="#Nt_127"><sup>[127]</sup></a> An Ungulate is essentially a running
  animal, and has no need of a grasping finger. Still Typotheria are placed
  by most within the Ungulate series, though their undoubted likenesses to
  other groups, especially to the Rodentia, are admitted, and indeed
  emphasised. Cope places them definitely with the Toxodonts.</p>

  <p>The Typotheria are an extinct group of smallish beasts, confined, like
  the Toxodontia, to South America, a region which during the Tertiary
  period, and into the Pleistocene, abounded with strange and varied types
  of Ungulate animals.</p>

  <p>The earlier forms of Typotheria may be exemplified by some <!-- Page
  213 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page213"></a>{213}</span>account of
  the genus <i>Protypotherium</i>. This animal was of about the size of a
  <i>Hyrax</i>, which indeed it resembles in several points of structure.
  The teeth have the primitive number of forty-four, and they are close
  set, leaving no diastema; the molars are rootless and grow persistently;
  they are simple and Rodent-like in surface pattern. The shape of the
  lower jaw is like that of <i>Hyrax</i>, being rounded in outline
  posteriorly; there is no projecting angle as in the Rodents, and this
  remark applies to the Typotheria in general. The aspect of the Rodent
  lower jaw is characteristically different from that of <i>Hyrax</i> and
  the forms under consideration.</p>

  <p>Some other characters of these early forms of Typotheria can be
  gathered from an inspection of other genera. In <i>Icochilus</i> both
  hand and foot were five-toed, and, as in ancient Ungulates generally, the
  bones of the wrist and of the ankle are serially and not alternately
  arranged. Moreover, an os centrale is present in the carpus. Both thumb
  and big toe were opposable. The skull has a remarkably Rodent-like
  appearance, but the palate is not so narrowed as in these animals.</p>

  <p>In the more recent forms of Typotheria the dentition has become
  reduced. The canines are lost, and as the incisors are reduced also, to
  one on each side of the upper, and two on each side of the lower jaw, the
  likeness to a Rodent skull is increased. There is also evidence of a
  modification from the more primitive forms in the loss of one premolar or
  even more, in the alternating bones of the carpus, in the disappearance
  of the centrale, and in the loss of a toe upon the hind-foot. In these
  more recent forms the fibula articulates with the astragalus instead of
  with the calcaneum. Typotheria of these more recent forms may be
  illustrated by the typical genus <i>Typotherium</i>. It has the reduced
  dental formula I&nbsp;1/2 C&nbsp;0/0 Pm&nbsp;2/1 M&nbsp;3/3; the molars are simple in
  pattern, and much like those of <i>Toxodon</i>. The upper incisors are
  powerful and curved, but are surrounded by a layer of enamel, which is
  not limited to the anterior face, as it practically is in Rodents. The
  sacrum is composed of a large number of vertebrae&mdash;some
  seven&mdash;a state of affairs which recalls the Edentata. The shoulder
  blade is not Ungulate in form. It has a strong spine, with an acromion
  and a well-developed metacromion. The terminal phalanges are enlarged and
  hoof-like.</p>

  <p>In the genus <i>Pachyrucos</i> there are three premolars, otherwise
  <!-- Page 214 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page214"></a>{214}</span>the formula is the same as in
  <i>Typotherium</i>. The animal seems to have had nails rather than hoofs.
  The thumb was opposable. The fibula is fused below with the tibia,
  whereas in the last genus these two bones are quite separate from each
  other.</p>

<h5><span class="sc">Sub-Order 5.</span> TOXODONTIA</h5>

  <p>The group Toxodontia,<a name="NtA_128"
  href="#Nt_128"><sup>[128]</sup></a> like so many others, is exceedingly
  hard to define. Nor are its limits any easier to mark out than many
  others of the groups of Ungulates. It will be best perhaps to give an
  account of <i>Toxodon</i>, and of a few types which seem to lie near it
  in the system, and then to indicate how far they resemble or depart in
  structure from other Ungulates. <i>Toxodon</i> itself is known from
  complete skeletons. It lived in Argentina during the "Pampean" period,
  which seems to be of the Pleistocene age. A large number of species,
  however, have been described, some of which seem to go farther back in
  time, and to have existed during the Miocene period further south in
  Patagonia.</p>

  <p>The size of this creature was about that of a large Rhinoceros; it has
  a bulky body and a large head, which was borne low down, on account of
  the bending downwards of the anterior vertebrae; in this aspect the
  figures of the skeletons recall <i>Glyptodon</i> and similar Edentates.
  The beast was discovered by Darwin, and originally described by Owen.
  "During his (Mr. Darwin's) sojourn in Banda Oriental," writes the Rev. H.
  Hutchinson, "having heard of some 'giants' bones' at a farmhouse on the
  Sarandis, a small stream entering the Rio Negro, he rode there, and
  purchased for the sum of eighteenpence the skull which has been described
  by Sir R. Owen. The people at the farm-house told Mr. Darwin that the
  remains were exposed by a flood having washed down part of a bank of
  earth. When found, the head was quite perfect, but the boys knocked the
  teeth out with stones, and then set up the head as a mark to throw at."
  The whole of the Pampean area is a valley of dry bones, and the remains
  of <i>Toxodon</i> are abundant there. The skull of <i>Toxodon</i> is not
  unlike that of a horse in general aspect; but the orbit is not separated
  from the temporal fossa. The premaxillae are furnished above with a
  slight protuberance directed towards <!-- Page 215 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page215"></a>{215}</span>the free end of the
  nasals, which may be related to the presence of a short proboscis. The
  zygomatic arch is strong and broad: the mandibles are provided with a
  long symphysis. The dental formula is I&nbsp;2/3 C&nbsp;(0-1)/1 Pm&nbsp;4/(3-4) M&nbsp;3/3.
  The teeth are prismatic and hypselodont, growing from persistent pulps.
  The molar teeth are slightly arched in form, whence the name of
  <i>Toxodon</i>, "bow teeth." The strong chisel-shaped incisors suggest
  the Rodents and <i>Hyrax</i>. The cheek teeth, moreover, are by no means
  unlike those of Rodents in their pattern. They are at any rate not at all
  like those of existing Ungulates. The small size of the canine and of the
  first premolar produces a diastema in the tooth series. The sacrum
  consists of five vertebrae, and the ischium does not articulate with
  it.</p>

  <p>The shoulder blade has a strong spine, but only a rudimentary
  acromion; nor is the coracoid well developed. The radius crosses the
  ulna, as in the Elephant; the whole fore-limb is shorter than the
  hind-limb, which must have exaggerated the hang-dog expression of the
  creature when alive. The elements of the carpus interlock in the modern
  fashion. Those of the tarsus, however, are primitive in lying below each
  other without alternation. The carpus has a centrale. The fibula
  articulates with the calcaneum. The femur has no third trochanter. There
  are three toes to all the limbs. It is clear that this assemblage of
  characters will not allow the placing of <i>Toxodon</i> in any living
  Ungulate order. If the middle toes appear by their slight pre-eminence to
  approach the Perissodactyle form, the peculiar surface contour of the
  molar teeth, letting alone the absence of a third trochanter on the
  femur, will not permit this classification.</p>

  <p>Allied to <i>Toxodon</i> is the genus <i>Nesodon</i>. It was so named
  from an "island lobe" on the inner side of the upper molars. This
  creature, smaller than <i>Toxodon</i>, also differs from it in the fact
  that the dentition is complete, and in the pattern of the molars, which
  is rather more complex. There is still the slight projection upon the
  premaxillary bones, but the nostril is directed more forwards than in
  <i>Toxodon</i>. The zygoma, too, is massive. The second pair of incisors
  in the upper jaw and the outer (third) pair in the lower jaw form biggish
  tusks in the adult. These and the molar teeth are, however, finally
  rooted, and do not grow, as in <i>Toxodon</i>, from persistent pulps. The
  genus is from the older Tertiary of Patagonia. Five or six species have
  been described. Some are as large as a Rhinoceros, others as small as a
  Sheep. <!-- Page 216 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page216"></a>{216}</span></p>

  <p>There is no doubt about the close alliance of the two genera just
  referred to. It is more doubtful whether <i>Homalodontotherium</i> and
  its allies should be placed, as they often are, in the neighbourhood of
  the Toxodonts. <i>Homalodontotherium</i> owes its name to its even row of
  teeth without a diastema. It was a creature of equally large size with
  <i>Toxodon</i>, and also came from the Tertiary strata of Patagonia. The
  teeth are the typical forty-four, and the molars like those of a
  Rhinoceros; they are, however, brachyodont and not hypselodont as in
  <i>Toxodon</i>. This genus, however, shows an important difference from
  the Rhinocerotidae and from the other Toxodontia in the fact that it was
  five-toed, and that the bones of the carpus and tarsus are set in
  relation to each other in the linear serial fashion.</p>

  <p>Undoubtedly a near relative of <i>Homalodontotherium</i> is
  <i>Astrapotherium</i>. This creature was of equal bulk, and was also
  Patagonian in range. The teeth are reduced in number, but the animal was
  provided, like a Wild Boar, with great tusks, which were, however, formed
  by the incisors. This animal is very imperfectly known; it is the form of
  the molars and the large size of the incisors which have led to its
  association with the Toxodontia. As to the resemblance of the teeth of
  this genus and of <i>Homalodontotherium</i> to those of
  <i>Rhinoceros</i>, it is difficult to regard it as evidence of near
  affinity. The likeness is probably to be looked upon as a case of
  parallelism in development. Exactly the same explanation is possibly to
  be given to the likeness which the teeth of <i>Toxodon</i> and
  <i>Nesodon</i> show to Rodents, or even to Edentates. As to their
  affinities Zittel observes<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>"The entirety of their osteological characters argues for the Toxodon
  a separate position in the neighbourhood of the Perissodactyla,
  Proboscidea, Typotheria, and Hyracoidea. The relations to the Rodentia
  rest mainly upon the converging development of the teeth, not upon true
  relationship."</p>

<h5><span class="sc">Sub-Order 6.</span> PROBOSCIDEA.</h5>

  <p>Large vegetable-feeding animals, usually scantily covered with hair,
  and with the nostrils and upper lip drawn out into a long proboscis.
  Digits five on both limbs. Femur and humerus not bent upon lower leg and
  fore-arm in a position of rest. Skull <!-- Page 217 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page217"></a>{217}</span>with abundant air
  cavities in the roofing and other bones. The incisors are developed into
  long tusks, which exist in the upper jaw alone, in the lower jaw alone,
  or in both jaws. There are no canines. The molars are lophodont. The
  clavicle is absent. The femur has no third trochanter. The bones of the
  carpus are serially arranged and do not interlock. The stomach is simple.
  The brain has much convoluted cerebral hemispheres, but the cerebellum is
  completely uncovered by them. The intestine is provided with a wide
  caecum. The testes are abdominal. The teats are pectoral in position. The
  placenta is non-deciduate and zonary. There are two venae cavae
  superiores.</p>

  <p>The position of the limbs in the Elephant tribe is unique among living
  animals: their straightness that is to say, and the absence or very
  slight development of angulation at the joints of the limb bones. This
  same feature has been observed in the extinct Dinocerata and in the
  Titanotheria. It must not, however, be assumed from the resemblance to
  these ancient forms that there is much affinity between them and the
  Proboscidea, or that the latter have retained an ancient feature of
  organisation. The oldest Ungulates for the most part, and the Creodonts
  to which they are undoubtedly related, have much bent limbs. It must be
  considered, therefore, that the arrangement obtaining in the Elephants is
  purely secondary. Professor Osborn has put forward the reasonable view<a
  name="NtA_129" href="#Nt_129"><sup>[129]</sup></a> that the vertical
  limbs of all these colossal creatures are due to "an adaptation designed
  to transmit the increasing weight" of these animals. The huge bulk of the
  body is better borne by vertical pillars than by an angulated limb. Other
  points, however, such as the exposure of the cerebellum, the two venae
  cavae, the five digits, and the absence of a third trochanter, argue a
  low position for the Proboscidea in the Eutherian group.</p>

  <p>The group can be readily divided into two families, the Elephantidae
  and the Dinotheriidae. We will commence with the former.</p>

  <p>The Elephants proper, <b>Elephantidae</b>, differ from the
  Dinotheriidae in, and are characterised by, a number of anatomical
  features. They possess long tusks (incisors) either in both jaws, or, if
  only in one jaw, in the upper. The molar teeth are very large&mdash;so
  large that only a few of them are simultaneously in use. There are but
  three definable genera of Elephantidae, of which <!-- Page 218 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page218"></a>{218}</span><i>Elephas</i> alone
  survives. This genus also includes many extinct forms, both American and
  European, as well as Asiatic and African. The entirely extinct genera are
  <i>Stegodon</i> and <i>Mastodon</i>. The group is clearly one dwindling
  towards extermination. From the Middle Miocene downwards these great
  "pachyderms" have existed; and from the Miocene up to Pleistocene times
  they were almost world-wide in range and numerous in species.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Elephas</i> comprises usually large, but occasionally
  (the pygmy Elephant of Malta) quite small forms. The external features of
  the genus differ slightly in different species, and will therefore be
  described in relation to those species which we shall notice here. The
  vertebral formula is C&nbsp;7, D&nbsp;19-20, L&nbsp;3-5, Sa&nbsp;4-5, Ca&nbsp;24-30, or even
  more.</p>

  <p>The bodies of the vertebrae are remarkable for their shortness and for
  the very flattened articular surfaces.</p>

  <p>The skull is large and massive. Its large and heavy character is, as
  has been stated in the definition of the sub-order, due to the immense
  development of air cavities in the diploe; the diameter of the wall of
  the skull is actually greater than that of the cranial cavity. These
  cavities are not obvious in the young animal. They are most conspicuous
  in the roofing bones of the skull, but are seen elsewhere, and thicken
  the basis cranii, <!-- Page 219 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page219"></a>{219}</span>the maxillae, and so forth. This state of
  affairs, together with the presence of the huge tusks, has, as it were,
  pushed back the nasal orifices to near the top of the skull in a very
  Whale-like fashion. As in the Cetacea, the nasal bones are limited in
  size, and the premaxillae send up processes to join the frontals and the
  nasals. There is a straight and somewhat slender zygomatic arch, but the
  orbit is not separated from the temporal fossa. The malar bone is small,
  and, as in Rodents, forms the middle part of the zygoma. This is not the
  case with most Ungulata. The symphysis of the mandibles forms a
  spout-like rim. The scapula has a narrow prescapular, but a very wide
  postscapular region. The spine has a strong process projecting backwards
  from near its middle; this is a point of likeness to certain Rodents. No
  Elephant has a clavicle. The most remarkable feature about the fore-limb
  is the separation and crossing of the radius and ulna. The arms of these
  animals are permanently fixed in the position of pronation. The foot is
  short, and the bones of the carpus are serially arranged. There are,
  however, traces of a commencing interlocking of these bones in many
  forms. The hind-feet are somewhat smaller than the fore-feet, and the
  tibia and fibula are both developed.</p>

  <p>As to the teeth, this genus is to be distinguished from allied forms
  by the presence of tusks in the upper jaw only. These tusks have no bands
  of enamel such as characterise those of <i>Mastodon</i>. They are
  incisors. There is, however, a trace of the former enamelling in the
  shape of a patch at the tip, which soon wears away. The molar teeth of
  <i>Elephas</i> are so large that the jaws cannot accommodate more than at
  the most two and a part of a third at a time. These are gradually
  replaced by others to the number of three, the replacement of teeth
  suggesting that of the Manatee. Each molar is deeply ridged, the
  interstices between the ridges being filled up with cement. As the tooth
  wears away, therefore, the surface continues to be flat. Each ridge
  consists of a core of dentine surrounded by a coat of enamel. The number
  of these ridges varies greatly from species to species. The Indian
  Elephant is one of those which have the greatest number of plates in a
  single tooth, as many as twenty-seven.<a name="NtA_130"
  href="#Nt_130"><sup>[130]</sup></a> Of the six molars which <!-- Page 220
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page220"></a>{220}</span>eventually
  appear, the first three are considered to correspond to premolars. But
  successional teeth are rare in the genus; that is to say as far as
  concerns the molars, for the tusks have their milk forerunners. As to the
  molars it is apparently only <i>E. planifrons</i> which certainly shows a
  milk dentition. In <i>Mastodon</i> and older types a milk dentition is
  commoner.</p>

  <p>The viscera of the Elephant have been examined by many zoologists. The
  latest paper, dealing chiefly with the African species, but containing
  facts about its Indian congener also, is quoted below.<a name="NtA_131"
  href="#Nt_131"><sup>[131]</sup></a> The Elephant is remarkable in
  possessing, in addition to the three usual pairs of salivary glands
  present in mammals, a fourth, situated in the molar region, and opening
  on to the cheek by many pores. This gland is especially well developed in
  Rodents. There is a gland which may be mentioned in this connexion,
  though it opens externally between the eye and ear, known as the temporal
  gland; its use does not seem clear. The thoracic cavity of the Elephant,
  as may be inferred from the large number of ribs, is very large as
  compared with the abdominal.</p>

  <p>The stomach is simple in form, and the epithelium of the oesophagus
  does not extend into it as is the case with the Horse and Rhinoceros. A
  gland or a collection of smaller glands occurs in the stomach, and
  recalls the "cardiac gland" of the Wombat and the Beaver, also that of
  the Giraffe. The large intestine is long, rather more than half the
  length of the small intestine. The caecum is well developed in these
  animals. The liver has a very simple form, being but slightly lobulated.
  It is actually only bilobed, but it is important to notice that this
  division does not correspond to the two halves of the liver. As shown by
  the attachment of the suspensory ligament, one half consists of the left
  lateral lobe alone, the other half embracing the remaining primary lobes.
  The simplicity of the liver looks like an archaic character. No Elephant
  has a gall-bladder. The lungs again are simple in form through their
  slight lobulation. Each half in fact is without subdivisions, and is of a
  triangular form. In this the Elephants resemble the Whales, as in the
  simple liver. In both cases probably the likeness is due to the
  permanence of primitive features of organisation. The brain<a
  name="NtA_132" href="#Nt_132"><sup>[132]</sup></a> of the Elephant <!--
  Page 221 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page221"></a>{221}</span>has
  hemispheres which are extremely well convoluted; but they leave the
  cerebellum entirely uncovered. This suggests a brain which is a great
  specialisation of a low type. The brain has been particularly compared
  with that of the Carnivora, with which group the Elephants agree in the
  characters of the placenta. It is, however, always a matter of the very
  greatest difficulty to compare the brains of mammals belonging to
  different orders.</p>

  <p>There are but two living species of Elephant, of both of which we
  shall now proceed to give some account. Only a few of the rather numerous
  fossil forms can be touched upon here.</p>

  <p>The African Elephant, <i>E. africanus</i>, has been sometimes referred
  to a distinct genus or sub-genus, <i>Loxodon</i>, by reason of the
  lozenge-shaped areas on the worn grinding-teeth. It lives, as its name
  denotes, in Africa. This species has a number of external features which
  enable it to be distinguished from the Oriental Elephant. The head slopes
  back more, and has not the two rounded bosses which give so wise a
  countenance to the Indian species. The ears are very much larger. The tip
  of the trunk has a slight triangular projection on both the lower and the
  upper part of the circumference of the aperture. There are four nails on
  the fore-feet and three on the hind. As in the Indian form, the toes are
  all bound together, and do not appear for any part as free digits. A
  thick pad of fat, etc., makes the animal when alive look as if
  plantigrade, whereas it is, as a matter of fact, digitigrade. In internal
  features the most prominent difference from <i>E. indicus</i> is in the
  molar teeth, which are ridged by much fewer ridges. The outside number
  for a single tooth in the present species is 10 or 11. In <i>Elephas
  indicus</i> on the other hand there are as many as 27.</p>

  <p>The African Elephant, thinks Sir Samuel Baker, reaches a height of
  about 12 feet, and it will be remembered that the notorious "Jumbo" was
  found to be 11 feet high at the shoulder. The tusks are found in both
  sexes, as in the Indian beast, but are relatively larger in the female in
  the species now under consideration. It is also a rather more active
  creature, and is more savage;<a name="NtA_133"

  <p>The meaning of an Elephant as an emblem. upon a coin appears to be
  eternity, and there is no question but that the <!-- Page 223 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page223"></a>{223}</span>Elephant is a
  long-lived animal. It is said that it hardly reaches proper maturity
  before forty, and that 150 years is not beyond probability in the way of
  longevity. Even longer periods have been assigned to it.</p>

  <p>The tusks of the Elephant are by no means necessarily sexual
  adornments, used for fighting purposes only. The African Elephant is a
  most "industrious digger," and grubs up innumerable roots as food. It
  appears to be a fact that during these operations the right tusk is
  mainly used, and in consequence that tusk is shorter as well as thinner
  than the other. Two average tusks would weigh respectively 75 and 65
  lbs., the latter of course being the weight of the more worn right tusk.
  These weights, it should be observed, by no means indicate the limits to
  which finely-developed tusks can attain. The very heaviest tusk known to
  Sir Samuel Baker<a name="NtA_134" href="#Nt_134"><sup>[134]</sup></a>
  weighed 188 lbs. This was sold at an ivory sale in London in the year
  1874. The pace of the African Elephant, says the same authority, is at
  most at the rate of fifteen miles an hour at first, and of course in a
  furious rush. This pace cannot be kept up for more than two or three
  hundred yards, after which ten miles an hour is a better approximation to
  the rate which can be kept up for long distances.</p>

  <p>The Indian Elephant, <i>Elephas indicus</i> (or <i>Euelephas
  indicus</i>, if the genus <i>Loxodon</i> is to be accepted), is better
  known and has been longer known than the African. It occurs in India and
  Ceylon, and in some of the Malayan islands, the Elephants of which latter
  parts of the world have been regarded as a distinct form, an apparently
  unnecessary procedure.</p>

  <p>This species does not stand so high at the shoulder as the African;
  its back is more rounded in the middle. The trunk has but one pointed
  tip; there are five nails on the fore- and four on the hind-feet. As this
  species comes from India and the East, it has been longer as well as
  better known than the African form. Thus many of the stories and legends
  that have congregated round Elephants apply really to this form. As is
  well known, the Indian Elephant is much used as a beast of burden, and
  for other purposes where its huge strength renders it invaluable. But its
  great drawback as a servant of man is its great independability. On the
  one hand we have furious, vicious, and generally unreliable <!-- Page 224
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page224"></a>{224}</span>Elephants, and
  on the other perfectly docile creatures, who obey the slightest hint from
  their driver. Huge though the Elephant is, it is frequently a timid
  beast. Sir Samuel Baker relates how one which he was riding fairly bolted
  at the sight of a Hare. To <!-- Page 225 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page225"></a>{225}</span>be bolted with by an Elephant is far from
  pleasing, though a rather exciting event. It makes for the nearest jungle
  at once, being, much more than the African species, an inhabitant of
  forest. And in rushing through the dense undergrowth, the occupiers of
  the Elephant's back are apt to be swept off or cut to pieces by
  innumerable thorns.</p>

  <p>Elephants, no doubt of the Indian species, were used by the Persians
  in battle, and from fifteen which were captured at the battle of Arbela
  some notes were drawn up by Aristotle. In stating that the animal reaches
  an age of 200 years, the naturalist and philosopher was probably not very
  far out. The mode of Elephant-catching as related by Aristotle is that
  pursued at the present day. Then, as now, tame Elephants were made use of
  as decoys. Pliny,<a name="NtA_135" href="#Nt_135"><sup>[135]</sup></a>
  who was apt to confound fact and fiction in a somewhat inseparable
  tangle, had something to say about Elephants, both Indian and African.
  Serpents, he thought, were their chief enemies, which slew them by
  coiling round them and thrusting their heads into the trunk, and so
  stopping respiration. In Europe Elephants were first seen in the year
  <span class="sm">B.C.</span> 280. Pyrrhus used them in his invasion, and
  copying his example the Romans themselves learnt to use Elephants. The
  first Elephant seen in England arrived in the year 1257, presented by the
  King of France to Henry III. It was kept in the Tower (for long
  afterwards a menagerie), and died at twelve years of age. Much use of the
  Elephant has been made in symbols. We have spoken of the African Elephant
  on Carthaginian coins as an emblem of eternity. The Oriental Elephant
  resting on the back of a tortoise and supporting the world is the same
  idea; and it is instructive to note that remains have been found in the
  Siwalik Hills of a tortoise which would have been actually big enough to
  support the creature, even "Jumbo," who weighed 6½ tons. Another symbol
  is that of an Elephant upon whose back is a child with arrows; this
  occurs on a medal of the Emperor Philip. It can perhaps hardly signify
  the eternity of a strong human feeling!</p>

  <p>The intelligence of the Elephant has been both exaggerated and
  minimised. Perhaps the most elaborate attempt to endow the beast with
  unusual mental perceptions is that of Aelian, who related that an
  Elephant carefully watching his keeper, wrote after him with his trunk
  letters upon a board. That the animal does <!-- Page 226 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page226"></a>{226}</span>possess a good deal of
  brains, seems to be shown by the way in which a well-trained animal will
  obey the slightest sign of the mahout in India. According to Sir Samuel
  Baker, localities which produce in abundance particular kinds of fruit
  are remembered, as well as the time at which the fruit will be at its
  best. Stories of revenge, which are numerous enough, attest, so far as
  their data are to be accepted as accurate, the power of memory possessed
  by the Elephant.</p>

  <p>In spite of their longevity, however, Elephants, unlike Rome, have not
  been built for eternity. We can only find two living species; but in past
  times Elephants were very numerous. They commenced, so far as we know, in
  the Miocene.</p>

  <p>The existing forms are known in a fossil, or at least sub-fossil
  state, from diluvial deposits; and it is interesting to note that the
  African Elephant had formerly a wider range than now. Its bones
  (described as <i>E. priscus</i>) have been met with in Spain and
  Sicily.</p>

  <p>One of the best known of completely-extinct Elephants is the Mammoth,
  <i>E. primigenius</i>. This great Elephant in most respects more nearly
  approached the existing Indian Elephant. The teeth have quite as numerous
  plates. The tusks were enormous, reaching a maximum length of 15 feet;
  they were much curved upwards as well as outwards. A large tusk weighs as
  much as 250 lbs. The Mammoth was of exceedingly wide range. Not only was
  it found in various parts of Europe, but it was especially abundant in
  Siberia, as is exemplified by the fact that for the last two hundred
  years as many or more than 100 pairs of tusks annually have been sold
  from that region. It also occurred in America together with forms at
  least not far removed from it, such as <i>E. columbianus</i>. Mammoths
  have been more than once found as entire carcases in the frozen soil of
  Siberia. The first was discovered in the year 1799, and rescued some
  years later for the St. Petersburg Museum. This example showed that the
  Mammoth, unlike existing Elephants, was covered with thick wool mingled
  with long and more bristly hairs of some 10 inches in length. The softer
  wool formed a kind of mane beneath the neck, which hung down as far as
  the knees. Another carcase was discovered later by Lieut. Benkendorf, who
  did not save it, but was nearly swept along with it into the sea by a
  flood. These creatures died in the position in which they were found by
  being bogged when in search of vegetation or water. <!-- Page 227
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page227"></a>{227}</span></p>

  <p>How primeval man, with his inferior weapons, slew the Mammoth is not
  easy to understand; but that they were contemporaneous is clearly shown
  by associated remains, and by the notorious sketch of the Mammoth on a
  piece of its own ivory, in which curved tusks and a forehead like that of
  an Indian Elephant are plainly to be seen. Although it was only so
  recently as the year 1799 that an example of this great creature was
  actually studied on the spot, and removed to St. Petersburg, the
  existence of Mammoths and of ivory is a matter of much more ancient
  knowledge. M. Trouessart relates<a name="NtA_136"
  href="#Nt_136"><sup>[136]</sup></a> that fossil ivory was known to the
  Greeks. Theophrastus spoke of ivory imbedded in the soil, and the tusks
  were recovered by the Chinese. It is a curious fact that the Chinese
  described and figured the Mammoth as a kind of gigantic Rat. The likeness
  between the elephantine molar and that of Rodents has been commented
  upon; but the existence of its tusks below the level of the ground led
  the Chinese Natural Historians to consider that the ways of life of the
  Mammoth were those of the Mole. As to the carcases themselves, the
  Chinese said that the flesh was cold, but very healthy to eat. This
  expression can hardly be explained, except upon the view that fresh
  carcases were known to that people long before they were known to us of
  the Western world. The value of the Mammoth ivory was known to antiquity;
  the famous Haroun-al-Raschid gave to King Charlemagne not only a pair of
  living Elephants, but a "horn of Licorne," which seems undoubtedly to
  have been a name for the tusks of the Mammoth. For in an account of the
  sacred treasures of Saint Denis, published in the year 1646, the author
  states this to be the fact.</p>

  <p>The causes of the disappearance of the Mammoth are not easy to
  understand. Some held that it was a naked animal like the existing
  Elephants, and that the lowering of the temperature in Siberia proved
  fatal; it is, of course, now certain that it was clothed with dense
  woolly hair. Along with the bogged corpses of the great pachyderm,
  numerous trunks of pine-trees have been found, together with associated
  remains of other animals now extinct in that neighbourhood. Thus it is
  plain that Siberia was once covered by mighty forests, through which the
  Mammoth roamed. The decay of these forests, upon whose branches the
  Elephant fed, as is attested by the remains of pine leaves found <!--
  Page 228 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page228"></a>{228}</span>in
  the interstices of its teeth, was the signal for the disappearance of
  their most colossal inhabitant.</p>

  <p>The large number of remains of this and of other extinct species of
  <i>Elephas</i> in this country gave rise to the supposition that they
  were Elephants brought over by Caesar to aid in the subjugation of these
  islands. The Rev. J. Coleridge (father of the poet) pointed out that
  though Caesar in his <i>Commentaries</i> made no mention of any such
  importation of Elephants, a passage in the <i>Stratagems</i> of Polyaenus
  expressly mentions that Cassivelaunus was confronted by the Romans with
  an Elephant clad in a coat of mail, by whose aid the crossing of the
  Thames was effected. At the time that attention was called to this (1757)
  it was not popular to hint at the possibility of fossils. So that fact,
  conveniently historical, served to explain away a difficulty. It is
  remarkable that the Elephant, common enough of course in Asiatic
  monuments, actually occurs in English architecture. Mr. Watkins, from
  whose interesting work (<i>Natural History of the Ancients</i>) a good
  many of the facts detailed here are drawn, tells us that the church of
  Ottery St. Mary has an Elephant's head sculptured on one of its pillars.
  The same ornament appears in Gosberton Church, Lincolnshire. Whether this
  has anything to do with a reminiscence of formerly existing Elephants is
  a hard question to answer. In this figure of an Elephant the trunk has a
  spiral representation, and the trunk of an Elephant is believed by some
  to be intended by the common "so-called Pictish ornamentation" in
  Scotland; this spiral alone is to be seen constantly. If it is a
  reduction of an Elephant to its simplest terms, it is highly interesting
  as an almost undoubted survival of remembrance of Elephants. For at such
  a period we cannot use the memories of Crusaders or others who may have
  visited the East to explain the facts. The sculptured Elephants' heads
  might conceivably be so explained.</p>

  <p>The name Mammoth, thinks Mr. Watkins, may be derivable from the Arabic
  word Behemoth. He quotes a writer, who first described the beast in 1694,
  as using the two words indifferently. The Arabs, moreover, were then as
  they are now great ivory traders; and in the ninth and the two succeeding
  centuries explored the confines of Siberia, as they now do the forests of
  Africa, for ivory. The "Behemoth" of Job "eateth grass as an ox.... He
  moveth his tail like a cedar" (the Hippopotamus has a much more <!-- Page
  229 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page229"></a>{229}</span>stumpy
  appendage). "Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not" is surely
  much more suggestive of the copious draughts of an Elephant than the
  possibly equally copious but not so visible libations of a
  Hippopotamus.</p>

  <p>The most ancient of the true Elephants (genus <i>Elephas</i>) is <i>E.
  meridionalis</i>. It is of the African type, <i>i.e.</i> the plates of
  the molar teeth are not abundant, and are not so many as in the existing
  <i>E. africanus</i>. It seems to have been one of the largest of
  Elephants, standing 4 metres high. Its remains are abundant in Europe,
  and are known also from England. Like this species <i>E. antiquus</i> is
  also of the African type. It was contemporary with man. Certain dwarf or
  "pony" races found in caves in Malta, and called <i>Elephas
  melitensis</i> or <i>E. falconeri</i>, are believed to belong to this
  species. Mr. Leith Adams, who described these<a name="NtA_137"
  href="#Nt_137"><sup>[137]</sup></a> remains, placed them in two dwarf
  species called by the names used above, and found associated with them a
  larger form, which he referred to <i>E. antiquus</i>. The existence of
  these animals in Malta seems to argue at least its former larger
  dimensions, and the presence of more abundant fresh water. The remarkable
  swimming capabilities of the Elephant do not necessarily imply either a
  former absence of land connexion or, on the other hand, its existence.
  Nor as a third possibility can it be suggested that the dwarf size argues
  an island of limited dimensions, when we bear in mind the huge tortoises
  of the Galapagos and some other islands. It is important to notice that
  Elephants of the African type (<i>Loxodon</i>) were not formerly absent
  from India. <i>E. planifrons</i> was one of these.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Stegodon</i> is so called from the fact that the molar
  teeth, seen in longitudinal section, present a series of roof-shaped
  folds, the interstices between which are not, or are, imperfectly filled
  up with the cement which in <i>Elephas</i> reduces the surface of the
  teeth to a level plane. This genus is exclusively Asiatic, and is Miocene
  to Pleistocene in time range. The number of ridges on the molars is
  small, not more than two. The incisors (tusks) have no enamel; the
  skeleton generally is like that of <i>Elephas</i>, between which and
  <i>Mastodon</i> the present genus is intermediate. Among the four or five
  species is <i>S. ganesa</i> (called after the Indian Elephant-headed
  divinity), with tusks 10 feet long, to be seen at the British Museum of
  Natural History. <!-- Page 230 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page230"></a>{230}</span></p>

  <p>The last genus of the family Elephantidae is <i>Mastodon</i>, so
  called from the structure of the molar teeth. These are provided with but
  few transverse ridges, not more than five, so that their structure is
  intermediate between those of <i>Dinotherium</i> and those of
  <i>Stegodon</i>. Between the ridges are sometimes isolated, boss-like
  protuberances (whence the name of <i>Mastodon</i>), produced by a
  subdivision of the ridges. There is either but little or no cement
  between the ridges. This genus differs from nearly all other Elephantidae
  by the possession of milk molars, which occasionally persist throughout
  life, the permanent dentition in those cases being a mixture of milk and
  permanent teeth, as has been (erroneously) stated of the Hedgehog.<a
  name="NtA_138" href="#Nt_138"><sup>[138]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The tusks (incisors) are sometimes present in both jaws, and as they
  have, during youth at any rate, a coating of enamel, the likeness to the
  chisel-shaped incisors of Rodents is patent. In connexion with the
  implantation of incisors in the lower jaw, many species have a
  prolongation of the bones of that part of the skeleton. In the bones,
  generally, there is not very much difference from <i>Elephas</i>, but the
  forehead is a little less pronounced. The genus existed from the Miocene
  and became extinct in the Pleistocene. It was nearly world-wide in range,
  being known from all four continents. Naturally with this very wide range
  was associated a large number of species. Zittel enumerates no less than
  thirty-two.</p>

  <p>This genus is the only one of the Elephantidae which extended its
  range into South America, where the remains of two species occur. The
  bones of these great Elephants have attracted attention for some
  centuries. They were often held to be the bones of giants (as they
  actually were!), and in one case were ascribed to a deceased monarch,
  Teutobochus. The American Indians considered that equally gigantic men
  lived who were able to combat these great Proboscideans. There are
  legends of the Mastodons as living animals, which is quite probable,
  considering their geological age. There is a curious parallelism between
  the legends of two such widely-separated localities as North America and
  Greece. Buffon relates how among the Indians of Canada there was a belief
  that the Great Being destroyed both Mastodons and men of equal
  proportions, with thunderbolts. With this we may perhaps compare the
  story of the destruction of Typhoeus by Zeus, who <!-- Page 231 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page231"></a>{231}</span>also used thunderbolts.
  One of the giants was not slain, but was compelled to stand and bear up
  the heavens. Atlas holds thus the position of the Elephant supporting the
  globe of Indian mythology.</p>

Miocene, Germany. (After Kaup.)</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Dinotherium</i>, sole representative of the family
  <b>Dinotheriidae</b>, differs in a number of important particulars from
  the true Elephants. In the Elephants, if there is but a single pair of
  incisors, these are found in the upper jaw; in <i>Dinotherium</i> there
  is apparently but a single pair, but these are implanted in the lower
  jaw, the symphysis of which is much prolonged and greatly bent downwards,
  so that the tusks emerge at right angles to the long axis of the head,
  and are even bent backwards. The molar teeth are five in number on each
  side of each jaw and are bi- or tri-lophodont, not unlike those of the
  Tapir. There is no cement in the valleys between the ridges of these
  teeth, and there is a regular succession, the premolars being two and the
  molars three.<a name="NtA_139" href="#Nt_139"><sup>[139]</sup></a> All
  the teeth are in use at the same time, <!-- Page 232 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page232"></a>{232}</span>their small size
  enabling them to be accommodated in the jaw together. The skull of
  <i>Dinotherium</i> is lower than that of <i>Elephas</i> or
  <i>Mastodon</i>. The bones of the skeleton generally are like those of
  <i>Elephas</i>.</p>

  <p>Though a suggestion of marsupial bones attached to the pelvis has been
  discredited, there is no doubt that <i>Dinotherium</i> occupies the most
  primitive position among the Proboscidea; but at the same time it cannot
  be regarded as the ancestor of Elephants, as it is so much specialised in
  various ways. The incisors for one thing forbid this way of looking at
  the creature. It is an ancient genus found in beds of Miocene age in
  Europe and Asia. It is not known from America. The creature was larger
  than any Elephant. Eighteen feet in length has been assigned to it. The
  enormous weight of the lower jaw and tusks seems to argue that it was at
  least partially aquatic in habit, and that it may have used these tusks
  for grubbing up aquatic roots or for mooring itself to the bank. At first
  there were naturalists who considered it as an ally of the Manatee, and
  the skull is not unsuggestive of that of the Sirenia.</p>

  <p><i>Pyrotherium</i> has been referred to the Proboscidea; but our
  knowledge of that form is limited to a few teeth from Patagonian rocks of
  an uncertain age.<a name="NtA_140" href="#Nt_140"><sup>[140]</sup></a>
  They are simple bilophodont molars, very like those of
  <i>Dinotherium</i>. A tusk has been found in the neighbourhood of these
  teeth which may possibly belong to the same animal; but it is
  uncertain.</p>

<h5><span class="sc">Sub-Order 7.</span> HYRACOIDEA.</h5>

  <p>This group of small mammals contains only one well-marked genus which
  is usually named <i>Hyrax</i>, although <i>Procavia</i> seems to be the
  accurate term. Popularly these creatures are known as Coneys. They have a
  singular resemblance to Rodents, the short ears and much reduced tail,
  besides the squatting attitude adopted, contributing to this merely
  skin-deep likeness. They agree with other Ungulates in the structure of
  the molar teeth, which are much like those of <i>Rhinoceros</i>; in the
  absence of a clavicle; in the absence of an acromion; in the reduction of
  the digits of the limbs to four digits in the manus and three in the pes.
  On the <!-- Page 233 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page233"></a>{233}</span>other hand they differ from most Ungulates
  in the incisors growing from persistent pulps, a point in which they
  resemble the Rodentia. The muffle also is split as in those animals. The
  Hyracoidea are peculiar in the fact that in addition to the caecum at the
  junction of the small and large intestines, there are a pair of caeca
  (bird-like in being paired) some way down the large intestine. The dorsal
  vertebrae are unusually numerous, 22. The adult dentition according to
  Woodward,<a name="NtA_141" href="#Nt_141"><sup>[141]</sup></a> who has
  recently examined the matter, is I&nbsp;1/2 C&nbsp;(1/0) Pm&nbsp;4/4 M&nbsp;3/3, while the
  milk dentition is I&nbsp;3/2 C&nbsp;1/1 Pm&nbsp;4/4.</p>

      <a href="images/120.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/120.jpg"

<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 120.&mdash;Cape Hyrax. <i>Hyrax capensis.</i> × &#x215B;.</p>

  <p>The inclusion of the canine of the permanent set of teeth in brackets
  signifies that it is the milk canine which occasionally persists. It
  should further be remarked about the teeth that they are both hypselodont
  and brachyodont, the extremes being connected by intermediate forms.
  Another peculiarity of the genus is the dorsal gland, which is covered
  with hair of a different colour to that covering the body generally. This
  is present in all species.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Hyrax</i> (the most recent authority on the subject, Mr.
  Oldfield Thomas,<a name="NtA_142" href="#Nt_142"><sup>[142]</sup></a>
  only allows one genus) is limited in its range to Ethiopian Africa and to
  Arabia, including Palestine, It does not reach Madagascar. Mr. Thomas
  allows fourteen species with two or three sub-species. <!-- Page 234
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page234"></a>{234}</span></p>

  <p>Some of the Coneys live in rocky ground, while others, formerly placed
  in the genus <i>Dendrohyrax</i>, frequent trees, in holes in which they
  sleep. The Coney of the Scriptures is familiar, who is "exceeding wise,"
  though a "feeble folk." But the further observation that he "cheweth the
  cud but divided not the hoof," is obviously entirely wrong. As to the
  wisdom, it is said that this beast is too wary to be taken in traps;
  while the suggestion of chewing the cud is, according to Canon Tristram,
  to be interpreted in the light of a habit of working and moving its jaws
  which the animal has. The traveller Bruce kept one in captivity to see if
  it did really chew the cud, and found that it did!</p>

  <p>These Ungulates derive their name, which is that given by the late Sir
  Richard Owen, from the fact that the middle digit of the hand and foot is
  pre-eminent. As will be seen from Fig. 121, the axis of <!-- Page 236
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page236"></a>{236}</span>the limb
  passes through the third finger, which is larger than any of the others,
  and is symmetrical in itself. In this the present group contrasts with
  the Artiodactyla, where the axis is not "mesaxonic," but where there are
  two digits, on either side of the axis, which are symmetrical with each
  other. This arrangement of the limbs is highly characteristic, but
  appears to be not quite universal. In the Titanotheres, which form a
  group of the Perissodactyles, the fore-limbs are not quite accurately
  mesaxonic. Nor on the other hand can all Ungulates which show the
  Perissodactyle condition be safely included in the present group. The
  ancient Condylarthra and the Litopterna show precisely the same state of
  affairs. But other features in their organisation lead to their
  separation from the Perissodactyles, of which, however, the Condylarthra
  are probably ancestors. The Litopterna on the other hand, which possess
  even one-toed members like <i>Equus</i>, are believed to represent a case
  of parallelism in development. The number of functional toes varies from
  four to one. In the ankle joint the astragalus either does not, or does
  only to a comparatively slight extent, articulate with the cuboid as well
  as with the navicular bone. Moreover the fibula when present does not as
  a rule articulate with the calcaneum. In the opposed group of
  Artiodactyles the precise reverse of these conditions obtains. It is
  usually stated as part of the definition of this group that they do not
  possess horns of the type of those met with in the Cervicornia and
  Cavicornia. But the strong bony bosses on the skull of many Titanotheres,
  so curiously reminiscent of those of the not nearly related
  <i>Dinoceras</i> and <i>Protoceras</i>, may well have supported horns of
  the Ox and Antelope pattern.</p>

  <p>The teeth of the Perissodactyles are lophodont, more rarely bunodont.
  The selenodont Artiodactyle form of molar is not met with. The dental
  formula, moreover, is at least near the <!-- Page 237 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page237"></a>{237}</span>complete one, the more
  modern forms as usual being the more deficient in numbers of teeth.</p>

  <p>The dorso-lumbar vertebrae are as a rule twenty-three; but the extinct
  Titanotheres are again an exception; for, at least in
  <i>Titanotherium</i>, there are but twenty of these vertebrae&mdash;an
  Artiodactyle character. The femur has a third trochanter. There are so
  few recent Perissodactyles that an enumeration of the distinguishing
  characters of the viscera may very probably be useless for purposes of
  classification. But the living genera at any rate are to be separated
  from the living Artiodactyles by the invariable simplicity of the stomach
  coupled with a very large and sacculated caecum. The liver is simple and
  not much broken up into lobes, and the gall-bladder is always absent. The
  brain is well convoluted. The teats are in the inguinal region. The
  placenta in this group is of the diffused kind.</p>

  <p>The living Perissodactyles belong to three types only, indeed to three
  genera only (in the estimation of most), which are the Horses, Tapirs,
  and Rhinoceroses. But taking into account the extinct forms, they may be

  Amynodontidae, and Rhinocerotidae. It is conceivable, according to the

  sub-order, Ancylopoda) should be added to the Perissodactyle series.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Equidae.</b>&mdash;This family, which includes the living
  Horse, Zebras, and Asses, as well as a number of extinct genera agreeing
  with those types in structure, may be defined by the possession of but
  one functional toe, the two lateral ones being mere splints, or but
  little more. The molar teeth are hypselodont, and <!-- Page 238 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page238"></a>{238}</span>the premolars, with the
  exception of the first, resemble the molars in their pattern. The orbit
  is completely surrounded by bone. The incisors are chisel-shaped, with a
  pit on the free surface. The canines are rudimentary if present. The
  radius and ulna are fused, as are the tibia and fibula. Although for the
  sake of uniformity a family, Equidae, is here separated from its allies,
  it is quite impossible owing to the full state of our knowledge of this
  group to draw a really hard-and-fast line between this family and the
  Palaeotheriidae. We shall deal presently with the conjectured pedigree of
  the Horse, which naturally involves that family, and which presents an
  unbroken series from four-toed Perissodactyles to the present one-toed
  Horse, the various bones and teeth becoming modified in the course of the
  descent "with the regularity of clockwork." We are compelled to draw the
  line at functional second and third toes; directly these are no longer
  used the animal is a Horse in the strict sense! This is irrational and
  regrettable, but necessary for practical purposes, if <!-- Page 239
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page239"></a>{239}</span>we are to
  continue the plan of defining the various families of Mammalia.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Equus</i><a name="NtA_143"
  href="#Nt_143"><sup>[143]</sup></a> contains not only the Horse, but the
  Asses and Zebras. The genus is to be distinguished as regards external
  characters by the following features<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span>The
  body is thickly clothed with hair; there is a more or less bushy tail and
  mane; the colours are apt to be disposed in stripes of black or blackish
  upon a yellowish brown ground; this is of course best seen in the Zebras,
  but the wild Asses also have some traces of it, if only in the single
  cross-bar of the African Wild Ass, and it is even "reversionary" in the
  domestic Horse at times. There are no horns upon the forehead or
  elsewhere; the fore-limbs or both pairs have a callous pad upon the
  inside, which is possibly to be looked upon as an aborted gland, possibly
  originally of use as secreting some odorous substance calculated to
  enable strayed members of the herd to regain their companions. The
  terminal phalanx of each of the (functionally) single digits is enclosed
  in a large horny hoof.</p>

  <p>The main internal features of structure which divide this genus of
  Perissodactyles from the Rhinoceros or the Tapir, or from both, are: the
  existence of strong incisors, three on each side of each jaw; there are
  canines, but these are small and do not always persist in the full-grown
  mare. They are popularly known as "tusks" or "tushes." The first of the
  four premolars (the "wolf tooth") is small and quite rudimentary; it is
  often absent. As there are three molars, the present genus has the
  "typical" number of the Eutherian dentition, <i>i.e.</i> forty-four. In
  the skull the orbit is&mdash;as it is not in Tapirs and
  Rhinoceroses&mdash;completely encircled by bone. There is but one
  functional finger and toe on each hand (Fig. 121 C) and foot; the second
  and third digits are represented by mere splints, one of which may as an
  abnormality be enlarged, and reach nearly as far as the well-developed
  digit. There are even occasionally traces of digit number two.</p>

  <p>The Horse, <i>E. caballus</i>, is to be distinguished from its
  congeners by the small callosities on the hind-limbs which it possesses
  in addition to the larger ones on the fore-limbs. The hairy covering of
  the tail is more abundant, as is also the mane. The head too is
  proportionately smaller, and the general contour <!-- Page 240 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page240"></a>{240}</span>more graceful. Though
  Zebra markings are not usual upon <i>E. caballus</i>, there are plenty of
  examples of&mdash;what we may perhaps in this case term&mdash;a
  "reversion" to a striped state. The celebrated "Lord Morton's mare,"<a
  name="NtA_144" href="#Nt_144"><sup>[144]</sup></a> whose portrait hangs
  in the Royal College of Surgeons, is an interesting case of this. It was
  as a matter of fact thought to be an example of that rather
  doubtfully-occurring phenomenon, "telegony." Its history is briefly this.
  The animal was the offspring of a mare that had previously produced to a
  male Quagga a hybrid foal. Afterwards a second foal was produced by the
  same mare to an Arab sire. This foal, the one in question, was striped,
  and hence was thought to be an example of male prepotency. But instances
  are known of unquestioned Horses which show the same stripes, such as a
  Norway pony which had not even <i>seen</i> a Zebra!</p>

  <p>A last remnant of the naked palm of the hand and sole of the foot is
  left in the shape of a small bare area, smaller in the Horse than in the
  Asses, known technically as the "ergot," the term being that of the
  French veterinarians. As already mentioned, the Horse differs from the
  Asses and Zebras in the fact that the hind-limbs have callosities on the
  inner side. They are known as "chestnuts," and their nature has been much
  disputed. It has been suggested that they are the last rudiment of a
  vanished toe; but in all probability they are, as already suggested,
  traces of glandular structures, which are common, upon the limbs in many
  animals (see above, p. <a href="#page12">12</a>).</p>

  <p>It is a singular fact that there are apparently no wild Horses of this
  species. The case is curiously analogous to that of the Camel, which also
  is only known as feral or domesticated. Why the Horse should have become
  extinct as a wild animal, considering that when it does run wild it can
  thrive abundantly, is impossible to understand. Sir W. Flower thinks<a
  name="NtA_145" href="#Nt_145"><sup>[145]</sup></a> that "the nearest
  approach to truly wild horses existing at present are the so-called
  Tarpans, which occur in the Steppe country north of the sea of Azov
  between the river Dnieper and the Caspian. They are described as being of
  small size, dun colour, with short mane and rounded obtuse nose." But he
  adds that there is no evidence to prove whether they are really wild. In
  favour, however, of their possibly being wild and indigenous European
  Horses, may be <!-- Page 241 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page241"></a>{241}</span>mentioned the fact that their general
  build and appearance is highly suggestive of the wild Horses sketched by
  primitive man upon ivory.</p>

  <p>A really wild Horse, and possibly the ancestor of the European
  domestic Horse, is <i>E. przewalskii</i> of the sandy deserts of Central
  Asia. This animal has been believed to be a mule between the Wild Ass and
  a feral Horse; but if a distinct form, and probability seems to urge that
  view, it is interesting as breaking down the distinctions between Horses
  and Asses. The species possesses the four callosities of the Horse, but
  has a poorer mane and an asinine tail.</p>

  <p>There is no question that the Horse has been a domestic animal for
  very many centuries. Hieroglyphics appear to show that the Egyptians had
  not originally domesticated the Horse; it seems to have been first
  introduced among them by the Hyksos or Shepherd Kings.<a name="NtA_146"
  href="#Nt_146"><sup>[146]</sup></a> Whatever the date may be, it is
  certain that considerably anterior to the Egyptians the Assyrians and
  Phoenicians possessed Horses. In Western Europe the date of the
  introduction of the Horse seems to have been during the bronze epoch.
  Lord Avebury<a name="NtA_147" href="#Nt_147"><sup>[147]</sup></a> has
  pointed out that out of eighteen cases of graves in which the remains of
  Horse were found, twelve contained metal implements, <i>i.e.</i> 66 per
  cent. This does not of course prove that the Horse was domesticated at
  that period, but it throws doubt upon the earlier occurrence of the Horse
  in abundance. The Horse, however, does occur on the Continent associated
  with the remains of man during the Quaternary period.<a name="NtA_148"
  href="#Nt_148"><sup>[148]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Messrs. Cuyer and Alix enumerate between fifty and sixty domesticated
  races of Horse, not counting the supposed wild varieties which have been
  already referred to. These may be further subdivided; for instance, under
  the race "pony" we may distinguish the Irish, Scotch, and Shetland
  varieties, all of which, however, according to Sanson, have originated in
  Ireland. They are used, remark the authors above quoted, "par les jeunes
  filles des lords pour leurs promenades." The Arab, the Barb, the Suffolk
  Punch, etc., are among the numerous races of domestic Horses, into which
  to enter properly would require another volume, and that of large size.
  <!-- Page 242 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page242"></a>{242}</span></p>

  <p>The Asses and Zebras differ from the Horse in the characters mentioned
  under the description of <i>Equus caballus</i>. In addition to these may
  be pointed out a feature to which attention has been directed by Mr.
  Tegetmeier.<a name="NtA_149" href="#Nt_149"><sup>[149]</sup></a>
  According to him the period of gestation in the Horse is only eleven
  months; in the others more than twelve.</p>

<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 125.&mdash;Asiatic Wild Ass. <i>Equus onager.</i> × <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">20</span>.</p>

  <p>Opinions as to the number of species of Asses differ. On the most
  liberal estimate there are three Asiatic and two African species. The
  best known of the Asiatic Wild Asses is the Onager, <i>E. onager</i>. It
  is of a uniform yellowish, "desert" colour, with a dark stripe along the
  middle of the back, and is found in Persia, the Punjab, and the country
  of Cutch. The creature is of great swiftness; it has been stated to be
  untameable, but Mr. Tegetmeier makes the absolutely opposite statement
  that the Ass occasionally "becomes so tame as to be troublesome"! The
  Syrian Wild Ass, <i>E. hemippus</i>, hardly, if at all, differs from
  this.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:42%;">
      <a href="images/126.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/126.jpg"

<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 126.&mdash;Nubian Wild Ass. <i>Equus africanus.</i> × <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">20</span>.</p>

  <p>The Kiang, <i>E. hemionus</i>, seems to have more claims to
  distinctness. In the first place it has a more limited and a <!-- Page
  243 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page243"></a>{243}</span>different
  distribution; it is confined to the high tablelands of Thibet at an
  elevation of 15,000 feet and upwards. In correlation with this habitat it
  has a thicker and more "furry" coat, which is, moreover, of a darker
  shade than that of the Onager. This coat is shed in the summer, and
  replaced by one which is not so dark in hue. It is an interesting fact
  that the African Wild Asses approach to the zebra type in having at least
  traces of stripings. There are apparently two species. The best known,
  the Nubian Ass, <i>E. africanus</i>, is probably the parent of the
  domestic donkey. It has a dorsal longitudinal stripe, and another across
  the shoulder&mdash;in legend the marks of the Saviour. The matter of the
  name of this Ass seems difficult to decide. It has been called also <i>E.
  asinus</i> and <i>E. taeniopus</i>. It has been observed that this animal
  has a great aversion to water, and a delight in rolling in the
  dust&mdash;both of which characteristics argue a desert existence. But on
  the other hand the Kiang will plunge boldly into streams, yet it would
  seem to be the descendant of a purely desert form. The Ass is a
  longer-lived <!-- Page 244 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page244"></a>{244}</span>animal than the Horse. Mr. Tegetmeier
  calls attention to a donkey living in 1893 which had been ridden
  fifty-five years previously. The Horse, on the other hand, lives not much
  more than twenty-five years.</p>

  <p>A second species of African Wild Ass, <i>E. somalicus</i>,<a
  name="NtA_150" href="#Nt_150"><sup>[150]</sup></a> is distinguished by
  its greyer colour, by the absence of the shoulder stripe, by the very
  faint development of the dorsal stripe, and by the presence of numerous
  cross stripes upon the legs. It has, too, smaller ears, and a longer and
  more flowing mane. Mr. Lort Phillips, an experienced naturalist and
  traveller, saw a herd of these Wild Asses in Somaliland, which he
  regarded as being of quite a new species. A living example in the
  Zoological Society's Gardens led Mr. Sclater to an identical conclusion,
  which was supported, as he pointed out, by the fact that this Ass has a
  different range to the African or Nubian Wild Ass.</p>

  <p>Of the Zebras three species are usually allowed; these are <i>E.
  zebra</i>, the "Mountain" or "Common" Zebra, <i>E. burchelli</i>, <i>E.
  grevyi</i>, as well as <i>E. quagga</i>. Professor Ewart thinks that the
  Common Zebra, Burchell's, and the Quagga are not very distinctly marked
  off from each other. No one, however, has any doubt of the distinctness
  of <i>E. grevyi</i>. This latter differs from the rest in its larger
  size, in the large head and ears, and in the marked hairiness of the
  ears. It would seem to be a primitive type of Zebra, if the fact that the
  occasional reversion of hybrids to a parent form be allowed; for
  Professor Ewart found a cross-bred Zebra to present several
  characteristics in the face-marking of this, the finest of the Zebra
  tribe. Only four specimens of <i>E. grevyi</i> have been exhibited alive
  in Europe&mdash;two in Paris, and two in the Zoological Society's Gardens
  in London. The latter were presented to Queen Victoria by King Menelek of
  Abyssinia. The species was named by Professor A. Milne-Edwards in honour
  of a late President of the French Republic, from an example also sent by
  King Menelek.</p>

  <p>The Common Zebra has closer and darker stripes than Burchell's, but
  not quite so close as in <i>E. grevyi</i>. It has also a very
  characteristic arrangement of stripes on the withers in the form of a
  gridiron. This latter is wanting in both the other species. In <i>E.
  grevyi</i>, in fact, this part of the back is white. <i>E. zebra</i> has
  also a dewlap in front. <i>E. burchelli</i> has fewer and broader <!--
  Page 245 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page245"></a>{245}</span>stripes, and between them lie in many
  cases shadow-stripes of a faint brown.</p>

  <p>All these animals, and the Quagga too, are absolutely confined to
  Africa. Mr. R Crawshay,<a name="NtA_151"
  href="#Nt_151"><sup>[151]</sup></a> in describing what he considered to
  be a new variety, remarked upon the curiosity of <i>E. burchelli</i>.
  "They remain out in the sun on the plains all day long, not retiring into
  covert at all. They are then an intolerable nuisance to any one in
  pursuit of other game; indeed this may be said of them at all times. If
  once they notice you, they draw in and mob you in their
  curiosity&mdash;only, however, when one takes no interest in them, for
  when they fancy they are the object of the intruder's attention, no
  animals are more watchful and cunning in safeguarding themselves. If only
  their curiosity were manifested in silence it would not so much matter,
  but it vents itself in snorts and thundering stampedes, which puts every
  beast within earshot on the <i>qui vive</i>."</p>

  <p>Whether Burchell's Zebra<a name="NtA_152"
  href="#Nt_152"><sup>[152]</sup></a> can be further subdivided into
  species or sub-species appears to be doubtful. Dr. Matschie considers
  that <i>Equus boehmi</i> may be regarded as a valid form, and in addition
  to this two sub-species, <i>E. burchelli granti</i> and <!-- Page 246
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page246"></a>{246}</span><i>E.
  burchelli selousi</i>, have been proposed for what are at most local
  races. But it is at present far from certain whether their distribution
  favours this subdivision.</p>

  <p>The Quagga was more striped than is sometimes represented in
  illustrations. According to Dr. Noack, from whose paper<a name="NtA_153"
  href="#Nt_153"><sup>[153]</sup></a> upon the animal I quote here, the
  transverse stripes reached back as far as the buttocks; they were,
  however, completely absent from the legs. The animal is, as every one
  knows, probably completely extinct. In the year 1836 it was still
  abundant; in 1864 the last specimen ever exhibited was received by the
  Zoological Society. Mr. W. L. Sclater thinks that it may have survived in
  the Orange River Colony as late as 1878, but admits that any certainty is
  difficult, as it was frequently confounded by the Boers with Burchell's
  Zebra. Its rarity is emphasised by the fact that it is not mentioned in
  the recent work of that most skilful of hunters, Mr. F. Selous. Gaudry
  places the Quagga nearest of all living Equidae to the <i>Hipparion
  gracile</i> of Pikermi.</p>

  <p><b>Fossil Equidae.</b>&mdash;The existing Equidae all belong to the
  genus <i>Equus</i>, though there are some who would (quite unnecessarily)
  divide off the Zebras as a genus <i>Hippotigris</i>. The genus
  <i>Equus</i> itself goes back in time to the Pliocene, during which epoch
  there lived in India <i>E. sivalensis</i>, the same species according to
  some with the <i>E. stenonis</i> of Europe. None of these species, Old
  World or New, are easily to be separated from <i>E. caballus</i>. But
  many names have been given to them. It is of course perfectly conceivable
  that they may have differed among themselves as much as do the existing
  Zebras and Asses, the separation of which would be hardly possible did we
  know their bones only. There are, however, extinct genera, undoubtedly
  related so closely to <i>Equus</i> as to be placed in the same family,
  though clearly separable as genera. <i>Hipparion</i> is one of these
  genera; its remains are known from Europe, Asia, and North Africa, from
  beds of Miocene and Pliocene times. A large number of different species
  have been described. It was a beast of about the size of a Zebra. The
  principal characters are that each foot has three toes, of which,
  however, the two side ones are smaller than the central toe. There is a
  marked round fossa on the maxillary bone, a feature shared by the South
  American <i>Onohippidium</i>.<a name="NtA_154"
  href="#Nt_154"><sup>[154]</sup></a> The pattern of <!-- Page 247 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page247"></a>{247}</span>the molar teeth is,
  too, a little different from that of <i>Equus</i>. <i>Protohippus</i> of
  the North American Pliocene is also three-toed, but the two
  additionally-developed toes are smaller than in <i>Hipparion</i>. Other
  forms are dealt with below in connexion with the ancestry of
  Perissodactyles. It is a curious fact about <i>Hipparion</i>, which is
  not now regarded as on the direct line of equine descent, that the edges
  of the enamel plates of the molars may show a complicated folding very
  like that presented by that clearly terminal form of Perissodactyle life,
  the gigantic <i>Elasmotherium</i>. This is indicative of high
  specialisation, which ended in extinction.</p>

  <p><b>Ancestry of the Horses.</b>&mdash;The <b>Lophiodontidae</b> and the
  <b>Palaeotheriidae</b> are two of the most interesting extinct families
  of Perissodactyles; for among them we find what would appear to be the
  ancestral forms of both the existing Tapirs and Horses. The Rhinoceroses
  also would seem to be derivable from the Palaeotheriidae. The very
  vagueness of the characters of these creatures, considered from a
  classificatory point of view, has led to much diversity in their placing.
  This though gratifying to the evolutionist is tiresome to the writer who
  wishes to give a methodical account of their various characters. It will
  be best perhaps not to attempt an accurate placing or to reconcile
  conflicting opinion, but to give some salient features of osteology which
  lead to the belief in their relationship to existing groups of
  Perissodactyles. A book upon the history of mammals would be incomplete
  without some account of that well-ascertained series of forms which seem
  to connect these primitive Perissodactyles with the modern Horse.
  <i>Equus</i>, in fact, is not only the "show horse" of the doctrine of
  evolution, but also the "stalking horse."</p>

  <p>In the Eocene of both Europe and America are met with a number of
  forms from which we may start. <i>Hyracotherium</i>, regarded on the one
  hand as the type of a sub-family of the Equidae themselves, and on the
  other as a member of the family Lophiodontidae, was a small-sized animal,
  three feet or so in length; it possesses the complete Eutherian dentition
  with a slight diastema. The orbits are not separated from the temporal
  fossa; the fore-limbs were four-toed, the hind three-toed, with
  moderately long metapodia, especially on the hind-feet. The shoulder
  blade <!-- Page 248 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page248"></a>{248}</span>has a well-marked coracoid process. The
  radius and ulna are separate; so too are the tibia and fibula.
  <i>Eohippus</i>, belonging to the same sub-family, is slightly more
  primitive; for the hind-feet have a rudiment of digit I. <i>Orohippus</i>
  is a little nearer to the Horses in that the molar teeth have acquired a
  little further advance towards the equine type. Instead of the tubercles
  of the teeth remaining for the most part separate, they have fused into a
  set of ridges, of which, however, the pattern is less complex than in the
  modern Horses. In other respects <i>Orohippus</i> is much like
  <i>Hyracotherium</i>. <i>Pachynolophus</i> seems to be but a synonym.</p>

  <p>The next stage is shown by <i>Mesohippus</i>, a Lower Miocene form,
  usually referred to the neighbourhood of <i>Palaeotherium</i>. It has
  nearly lost one of the toes of the fore-foot, a rudiment only remaining;
  the metapodials, at any rate of the fore-feet, seem to be slightly
  increased in length. The orbit is not encircled by bone, but there is a
  strong process from the frontal, which nearly meets the zygomatic
  arch.</p>

  <p><i>Anchitherium</i>, from the Upper Miocene, is not far removed in
  structure from the last-mentioned form; it is a trifle nearer the
  existing Horse in several points. The ulna is further reduced and fused
  with the radius below: the rudiment of digit V is still more rudimentary;
  the two lateral digits are smaller in proportion to the central one than
  they are in <i>Mesohippus</i>; the fibula is fused below with the tibia.
  From this form to <i>Equus</i> is a small series of steps, characterised
  by the still further reduction of all the digits except III, by the still
  further reduction of the already rudimentary ulna and fibula, and by the
  increasing depth of the molar teeth, which are of course, in
  <i>Equus</i>, hypselodont.</p>

  <p>Another interesting conclusion may seem to follow when we consider the
  geographical range of the ancestral Horses. <i>Hyracotherium</i> and
  <i>Pachynolophus</i> occurred both in the Old and New World. From them
  may have arisen the Horses of both hemispheres. After that point there is
  a division. <i>Mesohippus</i> is American, and we get at <i>Equus</i> in
  that continent through <i>Desmatippus</i> and <i>Protohippus</i>. On the
  other hand there are no remains known of <i>Mesohippus</i> in Europe; and
  unless subsequent researches prove the existence of <i>Mesohippus</i>, we
  have to rely upon forms which are placed with <i>Anchitherium</i> and
  <i>Hipparion</i>.</p>

  <p>It seems that in America the next genus in the direct line of equine
  descent to <i>Mesohippus</i> is <i>Miohippus</i>. It is smaller in <!--
  Page 249 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page249"></a>{249}</span>size
  than <i>Anchitherium</i>, to be considered immediately. The odontoid
  process of the axis is just beginning to assume the characteristic
  spout-like shape of that of the existing Horse and many modern Ungulates.
  The median digit of both fore- and hind-limbs has become greatly enlarged
  as compared with the corresponding digit of earlier forms.</p>

  <p>It is held, however, that <i>Anchitherium</i> is not on the direct
  line of descent either in America or in Europe, in both of which it
  occurs. Its teeth are in some respects less Horse-like than in some of
  the more ancient genera, to which the converse would be expected on the
  descent theory. Its hoofs are much elongated and flattened, a mark of
  specialisation and not appropriate to a creature holding an intermediate
  position in the equine series. Both the American (<i>A. equinum</i>) and
  the European species (<i>A. aureliense</i>) are of very large size,
  larger than its successors, and such "alternations in bulk are
  unlikely."</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Desmatippus</i> of Professor Scott<a name="NtA_155"
  href="#Nt_155"><sup>[155]</sup></a> fills in the gap between
  <i>Miohippus</i> and <i>Protohippus</i>. The molars and premolars are
  brachyodont, but there is a thin deposit of cement in the tooth valleys,
  leading towards the more complete filling of these valleys with cement,
  which is found in <i>Protohippus</i>. This genus of Horses, of which
  there is at present but one species, <i>D. crenidens</i>, was three-toed,
  and "the lateral digits, so far as can be judged by fragmentary remains,
  were still fairly developed, and though much more reduced than in
  <i>Miohippus</i>, appear to be somewhat less so than in
  <i>Protohippus</i>."</p>

  <p>To recapitulate, the following is the probable series of equines in
  America&mdash;<i>Mesohippus</i>, <i>Miohippus</i>, <i>Desmatippus</i>,
  <i>Protohippus</i>.</p>

  <p>The development of the limbs of the Horse shows a most interesting
  series, of stages, which correspond in part to the ancestral forms which
  palaeontology seems to prove to be the line of the descent of our
  existing Equidae. This matter has recently been elucidated by Professor
  Ewart, who details the following facts and comparisons<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>In the youngest embryo (about 20 mm. in length) the humerus is
  somewhat curved, and considerably longer than the radius and carpus taken
  together. The first-named bone is shorter in the adult, and the
  proportions of that bone in the young as well as its curvature are
  suggestive of that ancient <!-- Page 250 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page250"></a>{250}</span>Ungulate <i>Phenacodus</i> (see p. <a
  href="#page202">202</a>). In the next stage (an embryo of 25 mm.) the
  humerus has slightly decreased in proportionate length, and has come to
  be more like that of <i>Hipparion</i>. In both of these embryos it should
  be noted that the ulna is complete and separate from the radius. In the
  second of the two it has more distinctly acquired the form which it will
  possess in the adult. The second metacarpal&mdash;one of the splint bones
  of the adult&mdash;is tipped with a small nodule of cartilage, which is
  clearly the representative of one or more of the phalanges belonging to
  that digit.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Tapiridae.</b>&mdash;The Tapirs may be distinguished from
  the Horse and from the Rhinoceros tribe by a few characters, which are as
  follows<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>The dentition is generally the full one of forty-four teeth. The
  premolars in the more ancient forms are unlike the molars, but like them
  in more recent forms. The molars of the upper jaw have two crests
  parallel and united by an outer crest. The fore-feet have four, the
  hind-feet three toes.</p>

  <p>The family is fully as ancient as that of the Equidae, but the
  specialisation of the toes never advances so far. The modern
  representatives of the order are, so far as the feet are concerned, in
  the condition of very early representatives of the equine stock. Nor do
  the teeth of the Tapirs ever reach the complicated pattern of that
  presented by at least the modern Horses, or indeed of the Palaeotheres.
  Apart from this it is not an easy matter to distinguish accurately
  between these several families, including the Lophiodontidae, which, as
  already mentioned, is placed nearer to the Tapiridae than to the
  Palaeotheriidae. Indeed the differentiation of these two families, the
  Tapiridae and the Lophiodontidae, seems to be a matter of the greatest
  difficulty. The difficulty is well emphasised by the fact that
  naturalists disagree most profoundly as to the relations of various
  genera of extinct Tapir-like animals. For Mr. Lydekker the genus
  <i>Lophiodon</i> includes also the American genera <i>Isectolophus</i>
  and <i>Systemodon</i>, which are placed by Zittel in the sub-family
  Tapirinae as opposed to Lophiodontinae, which contains <i>Lophiodon</i>
  and <i>Helaletes</i>. The existing Tapirs can be differentiated from the
  existing Horses with great ease, as the following account of the existing
  genera will show.</p>

<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 128.&mdash;American Tapir. <i>Tapirus terrestris.</i> × <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">10</span>.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Tapirus</i> is now met with only in South and Central
  America, and in the Malay Peninsula and the islands of Java and Sumatra.
  This animal is in many respects the most ancient of existing forms
  referable to the Perissodactyle order. It has four toes on the
  front-feet, though only three on the hind-feet. The number of teeth is
  42&mdash;nearly the typical Eutherian number. The Tapirs are always
  moderately-sized animals, entirely covered with hair, and usually of a
  brownish-black colour. The Malayan Tapir is, however, banded broadly with
  white&mdash;a single band; the young of the Tapir is spotted, and striped
  with white. The nose and upper lip conjoined are produced into a short
  trunk, precisely comparable with that of the Elephant. As in the
  Rhinoceros&mdash;and in this both contrast with the other existing
  Perissodactyle genus <i>Equus</i>&mdash;the temporal fossa is not
  separated from the orbit by bone. Of existing Tapirs there are at any
  rate <i>T. terrestris</i>,<a name="NtA_156"
  href="#Nt_156"><sup>[156]</sup></a> <i>T. roulini</i> (the "Tapir
  Pinchaque" of Cuvier), <i>T. dowi</i> and <i>T. bairdi</i> in America
  (the last two being sometimes separated into a distinct genus,
  <i>Elasmognathus</i>, on account of the prolongation of the ossified
  mesethmoid), and <i>T. indicus</i> in the East. The tapir, probably <i>T.
  terrestris</i>, is described by Buffon as "a dull and gloomy animal." It
  is certainly mainly nocturnal in habit. The name <i>terrestris</i> was
  given by Linnaeus, who placed it in the same genus as <!-- Page 252
  --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page252"></a>{252}</span><i>Hippopotamus amphibius</i>; hence the
  epithet applied to the Tapir. But as a matter of fact it loves marshy
  neighbourhoods, and is in a way amphibious. This does not of course apply
  to the Andesian <i>T. roulini</i>, which inhabits the cordillera of
  Ecuador and Colombia. The distribution of existing Tapirs is, as is so
  often the case, restricted when compared with that of their extinct
  congeners and allies. In Europe the remains of the genus <i>Tapirus</i>
  are abundant from Pliocene strata, and its remains are there known from
  as far back as the Miocene. The genus is thus one of the very oldest
  forms of Mammalia at present inhabiting the earth.</p>

  <p>The Malayan Tapir is to be distinguished from the American (<i>T.
  terrestris</i>&mdash;the other species have not been dissected) by the
  greater development of the valvulae conniventes in the intestine, the
  absence of a moderator band in the heart, and the less elongated caecum,
  which is sacculated by only three bands, there being four in <i>T.
  terrestris</i>.<a name="NtA_157" href="#Nt_157"><sup>[157]</sup></a> The
  animal frequents the most retired spots among the hill woods, by which
  habit it seems <!-- Page 253 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page253"></a>{253}</span>largely to escape the Tiger, its most
  formidable foe in those regions of the world. Its quickness of senses
  enables it also to slip away with rapidity. It can proceed at a great
  pace when disturbed, and can readily push its way through obstacles. The
  young animal, like that of the American species, is dark brown with
  yellowish spots. It is stated by Mr. H. N. Ridley that the young animal
  lies during the hot part of the day under bushes, in which situation "its
  coat is so exactly like a patch of ground flecked with sunlight that it
  is quite invisible." It is interesting to note that here, as with some
  other animals, it is the young that are especially protected by such
  mechanisms. Moreover, some of the spots are round and some are more
  elongated, so that the resemblance to spots of sunlight which come in a
  direct and in a slanting direction is greatly increased. Even the colours
  of the adult are not so conspicuous when it is in its native haunts as
  might be supposed. The breaking up of the ground colour into tracts of
  two different colours prevent it from striking the eye so plainly as if
  it were of one colour throughout. "When lying down during the day it
  exactly resembles a grey boulder, and as it often lives near the rocky
  streams of the hill jungles, it is really nearly as invisible then as it
  was when it was speckled."<a name="NtA_158"
  href="#Nt_158"><sup>[158]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Rhinocerotidae.</b>&mdash;This family is to be
  distinguished from the preceding by a number of characters, which though
  not universal are general. In the first place, there are commonly horns,
  or a horn, consisting of what appears to be an agglomeration of hair-like
  structures fixed upon a roughened patch of bone on the surface of the
  nasals. The incisors are diminished or defective, and the upper canines
  are often wanting. The molars and premolars are alike. The fore-feet are
  four- or three-toed, but are functionally tridactyle; the hind-feet are
  three-toed. The skeleton in this family is massive, and the limbs
  relatively short. The skull, as in the Tapirs, has a confluent orbit and
  temporal fossa. The upper lip is generally more or less prehensile; the
  body is as a rule&mdash;to which the Pleistocene Hairy Rhinoceros is of
  course an exception&mdash;rather sparsely covered with hair. In this
  feature the Rhinocerotidae contrast both with the Tapiridae and the
  Equidae. The family in reality contains but one existing genus, though
  three have been instituted, viz. <!-- Page 254 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page254"></a>{254}</span><i>Rhinoceros</i>,
  <i>Ceratorhinus</i>, and <i>Atelodus</i>. As there are so few existing
  species the subdivision of animals which agree in so many and such
  highly-characteristic features seems to be an unnecessary procedure. The
  existing Rhinoceroses are but a fragment of the total number of known
  forms from past epochs. The family is very markedly on the wane.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Rhinoceros</i> is characterised by its heavy build and
  thick, almost smooth, skin&mdash;smooth, that is to say, so far as
  concerns the slight development of hair&mdash;which is often thrown into
  folds. There is one or there are two horns on the fore-part of the head,
  which are, as has already been pointed out, structures <i>sui
  generis</i>, and not exactly comparable with the horns of other living
  Ungulates. There are three nearly equal toes on both fore- and
  hind-limbs. The canine teeth of existing species have disappeared; the
  incisors are, or are not, present; the molars and premolars are three and
  four in each half of each jaw.</p>

  <p>The visceral anatomy of the Rhinoceros has been much investigated so
  far as concerns the Asiatic forms. A curious feature, which serves to
  discriminate some of the Asiatic species from others, is to be seen in
  the small intestine. In <i>Rh. indicus</i><a name="NtA_159"
  href="#Nt_159"><sup>[159]</sup></a> this gut is furnished with numerous
  long cylindrical narrow outgrowths "like tags of worsted"; in the allied
  <i>Rh. sondaicus</i> these tags are present, but are flatter and broader;
  while in the two-horned <i>Rh. sumatrensis</i> there are no tags at all,
  but only smooth valve-like folds. Another mark by which these species can
  be distinguished depends upon the variation in the presence or absence of
  certain glands imbedded in the integument of the foot&mdash;the so-called
  "hoof glands." These occur in <i>Rh. indicus</i> and <i>Rh.
  sondaicus</i>, but are absent in <i>Rh. sumatrensis</i>.</p>

  <p>Sir W. Flower<a name="NtA_160" href="#Nt_160"><sup>[160]</sup></a>
  studied some years since the skull features which serve to differentiate
  the existing forms.</p>

  <p>In <i>Rh. sumatrensis</i> the two long downward processes of the
  squamosal bone, termed respectively post-glenoid and post-tympanic, do
  not unite below the auditory meatus. In this the species in question
  agrees with the African forms but not with the one-horned Asiatic
  species, where the two processes completely fuse. Again, another
  character, though perhaps less important, <!-- Page 255 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page255"></a>{255}</span>is the sloping
  backwards instead of forward of the occipital crest in all two-horned
  species, whether African or Asiatic.</p>

  <p>The Asiatic Rhinoceroses have, what the African animals have not,
  functional incisor teeth throughout life. It has been proposed on these
  and other grounds to separate generically the African and Asiatic
  forms.</p>

<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 130.&mdash;Indian Rhinoceros. <i>Rhinoceros indicus.</i> × <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">40</span>.</p>

  <p>The Asiatic Rhinoceroses include three well-differentiated species, in
  all of which the skin is much thrown into folds. <i>Rh. indicus</i> is
  the largest form. It is one horned, and has enormous folds of skin at the
  neck and hanging over the limbs. So like artificial armour is this thick
  plating, that Albrecht Dürer may be excused for having given the beast
  the appearance of being actually mail-plated in a sketch which he made of
  a specimen sent over to the King of Portugal in 1513. This particular
  beast, one of if not the first sent over to Europe, proved so intractable
  in disposition that the king sent it as a present to the Pope. But "in an
  access of fury it sunk the vessel on its passage"! The horn of this and
  of other species was held until almost our times to have medicinal and
  other more curious values. So recently as 1763 it was gravely asserted
  that a cup made of its horn would fall to pieces if poison were poured
  into it. "When wine is poured therein," wrote Dr. Brookes in the year
  referred to, "it will rise, ferment, and seem to boil; but when <!-- Page
  256 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page256"></a>{256}</span>mixed with
  poison it cleaves in two, which experiment has been seen by thousands of
  people." John Evelyn also wrote of a well in Italy which was kept sweet
  by a Rhinoceros' horn. This species seems to be long-lived, even in
  captivity; a specimen now to be seen in the Zoological Society's Gardens
  has been there since the year 1864.</p>

  <p><i>Rhinoceros sondaicus</i>, the Rhinoceros of the Sunderbunds, has a
  much wider range than the last species or Indian Rhinoceros. This is
  unknown out of India itself, and is there limited to a small region; the
  Sondaic form is found in Bengal and in the Malayan Islands. It is a
  smaller species, and the armour has a tesselated appearance. The female
  generally, if not always, is hornless.</p>

  <p>The Sumatran species, <i>Rhinoceros sumatrensis</i>, is to be

  much thicker coat of hairs, which are sometimes blacker and sometimes
  redder. On account of its two horns it has been proposed to separate it
  from the other Oriental species into a distinct genus,
  <i>Ceratorhinus</i>. The animal has much the same range as the last
  species, but extends to Borneo. A variety of this species with hairy
  ears, from Assam, has been separated as a distinct form, under the name
  of <i>Rh. lasiotis</i>, by Mr. Sclater. The animal upon which that

  <p>There are only two certainly-known species of Rhinoceros in Africa.
  These are the White Rhinoceros (<i>Rh. simus</i>) and the Black
  Rhinoceros (<i>Rh. bicornis</i>). The origin of the names is not easy to
  understand, since the "white" animal is, if anything, darker in colour
  than the Black Rhinoceros. It is stated, however, that in past years the
  specimens of <i>Rh. simus</i> found in the south-west of Cape Colony were
  "paler and whiter in colour than those in the north-east." At present
  there are no grounds for distinguishing the species by their colour
  characters. But they are plainly distinguishable on other grounds.
  <i>Rhinoceros simus</i> has a square upper lip, and in relation to this
  crops the herbage upon the ground. <i>Rh. bicornis</i> has a prehensile
  upper lip projecting beyond the lower, and in a corresponding fashion
  feeds principally upon the branches of shrubs, It has been pointed out by
  Mr. <!-- Page 258 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  href="#Nt_161"><sup>[161]</sup></a> that the calf of <i>Rh. simus</i>
  "always runs in front of the cow, while the calf of <i>Rh. bicornis</i>
  invariably follows its mother." Both animals of course have two horns,
  and upon the varying proportions of the horns a large number of "species"
  have been made in the past. It is stated that the longest horn of the
  "White Rhinoceros" known measures 56½ inches; while that of <i>R.
  bicornis</i> is shorter, 40 inches being apparently the maximum. But the
  animal is smaller.</p>

  thus confined to Africa, to certain parts of the continent of Asia, and
  to some of the large islands lying to the south of that continent. But
  formerly the genus, and allied genera, had a wider range. As far back as
  the Miocene we meet with remains of Rhinoceroses closely allied to
  existing forms. The more ancient forms have, as is natural, more ancient
  characters. Thus in <i>Rh. schleiermacheri</i> of the Miocene, canines
  appear to have been present. The Miocene <i>Aceratherium</i>, primitive
  in the absence of horns as its <!-- Page 259 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page259"></a>{259}</span>name denotes,<a name="NtA_163"
  href="#Nt_163"><sup>[163]</sup></a> had also canines and, in one species,
  six incisors in the lower jaw. This <i>Aceratherium</i> had, moreover,
  four toes in the fore-feet. In the Miocene and later the Rhinoceros
  existed in Europe and America. There was even a purely northern form, the
  <i>Rh. tichorhinus</i>, which possessed a woolly covering and had the
  same range as the Mammoth. This Rhinoceros was two-horned.</p>

  <p>The post-Pliocene and European <i>Elasmotherium</i> was a colossal
  rhinocerotine creature. This great beast had two horns and a body 15 feet
  long. Its limbs are not known, and as the teeth are different from those
  of Rhinoceroses in general, it may not have belonged to this group at
  all, though Osborn is inclined to derive it from <i>Aceratherium</i>,
  admitting at the same time that the evidence is "decidedly slender." The
  teeth in fact are like those of a Horse in being hypselodont and
  prismatic in form. As to the two horns, they were apparently not exactly
  like those of typical Rhinoceroses; there was an enormous horn
  posteriorly, supported on a huge boss of bone, and in front of this a
  roughened spot suggests a smaller or at least a much more slender
  horn.</p>

  <p>It is important to notice that fossil Rhinoceroses belonging to the
  restricted genus <i>Rhinoceros</i> were in Europe invariably two-horned;
  it is only in India, where they still exist, that one-horned forms are
  met with in a fossil state.</p>

  <p>The Rhinoceroses of America were mostly hornless. <i>Diceratherium</i>
  is an exception; but in many cases it had two parallel not successive
  horns, and these were, to judge from the slight prominences, but feeble
  in development, and perhaps hardly exactly comparable with the formidable
  weapons of the Old-World forms. <i>Aceratherium tridactylum</i>, with
  indications of paired horns, may be ancestral to <i>Diceratherium</i>.
  The American forms have weak and slender nasals in correspondence with
  the absence of horns; the sagittal crest is retained in contradistinction
  to the great flattened surface of the skull in the horned Rhinoceroses.
  <i>Aceratherium</i> of both divisions of the globe probably represents
  the ancestral group of the horned and the hornless forms. This being the
  case it is highly interesting to note a distinct convergence in the quite
  <!-- Page 260 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page260"></a>{260}</span>separate American genera towards the
  European horned genera. A genus sometimes united with
  <i>Aceratherium</i>, but still differing from it in some points, is
  <i>Aphelops</i> (<i>Teleoceras</i>).<a name="NtA_164"
  href="#Nt_164"><sup>[164]</sup></a> This animal is more nearly
  approximated to "the modern standard" of Rhinoceroses than is its
  possible ancestor <i>Aceratherium</i>. The skeleton in general is more
  robust, even surpassing that of modern forms, and approaching the
  <i>Hippopotamus</i>. There is a reduction in the upper incisors, which
  are limited to two pairs, and the lower molars<a name="page261"></a> <!--
  Page 262 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page262"></a>{262}</span>are
  reduced to five. The lower incisors are only two. The sagittal crest is
  less marked; the fifth digit is reduced to a tiny nodule representing the
  metacarpus. It had a small nasal horn. There are numerous other details
  of likeness to modern Rhinoceroses in this creature, which has only
  community of descent with them from the older hornless forms, such as
  <i>Aceratherium</i> and <i>Caenopus</i>. In the genus <i>Peraceras</i>
  the upper incisors are as completely gone as in the living African
  Rhinoceroses.</p>

  <p>The most ancient rhinocerotine types<a name="NtA_165"
  href="#Nt_165"><sup>[165]</sup></a> are the Hyracodonts and the
  Amynodonts. They both date from the Eocene, and became extinct in the
  succeeding Oligocene. <i>Hyracodon</i><a name="NtA_166"
  href="#Nt_166"><sup>[166]</sup></a> (Fig. 134) was "an agile,
  light-chested, and rather long-necked" type, resembling a Horse in build.
  There were no horns present, but the hoofs were more like those of the
  Horses than of the existing Rhinoceroses. These animals were apparently
  plain dwellers and defenceless, which is held to account for their
  compact hoofs and outward similarity to a Horse. The genus is Oligocene.
  The dental formula is I&nbsp;3/3 C&nbsp;1/1 Pm&nbsp;4/3 M&nbsp;3/3.</p>

  <p>It is surmised by Professor Scott that the number of dorso-lumbar
  vertebrae was twenty-three or twenty-four. The radius and ulna are
  complete and separate bones, but the latter is somewhat reduced. There
  are four metacarpal bones, of which, however, the fifth is much reduced.
  The animal is only three-fingered. The tibia and the fibula are distinct,
  and show no tendencies towards fusion; but the fibula is much reduced.
  There are only three metatarsals and three toes. Had this line, which is
  to be regarded as a side branch of the Rhinoceros stem, not died out, it
  would probably have resulted, thinks Professor Scott, in
  monodactyle&mdash;very Horse-like types. It is later than the next genus
  to be described, <i>Hyrachyus</i>, of which it is possibly a descendant.
  An intermediate type, <i>Triplopus</i>, appears to bind together
  <i>Hyracodon</i> and <i>Hyrachyus</i>.</p>

  <p>In <i>Hyrachyus agrarius</i> the skull is long and narrow, the facial
  region being markedly longer than in existing Rhinoceroses. The mastoid
  portion of the periotic bone is widely exposed upon the outer face of the
  skull, which is, as has been said, not the case with the existing genus
  <i>Rhinoceros</i>. The dentition is the complete Eutherian dentition of
  forty-four teeth. The upper <!-- Page 263 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page263"></a>{263}</span>molar teeth are strikingly like those of
  the genus <i>Rhinoceros</i>. The fore-feet are pentadactyle, but
  functionally tetradactyle; the hind-feet tridactyle. The ulna is less
  reduced than in <i>Hyracodon</i>, and the dorso-lumbar vertebrae are
  twenty-five.</p>

  <p>The Amynodonts were short, heavy types, probably marsh-haunting in
  habit, and possibly with a proboscis like that of the Tapir. The orbit is
  higher than it is in the purely terrestrial <!-- Page 264 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page264"></a>{264}</span>Hyracodonts, and it is
  suggested that when swimming it was raised above the surface as with the
  Hippopotamus. "This feature," observes Professor Osborn, "with the long
  curved tusks, undoubtedly used in uprooting, suggests the resemblance
  between the habits of these animals and those of the hippopotami." There
  were no horns in the Amynodonts. The face is shorter than in the
  Hyracodonts, and the mastoid is covered as in recent Rhinoceroses. The
  canines are very strongly developed into tusks, but the incisors show
  signs of disappearance. We know of the genera <i>Amynodon</i>,
  <i>Metamynodon</i>, and <i>Cadurcotherium</i>. All except the last, which
  is European, are American in range.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Titanotheriidae.</b>&mdash;These Oligocene Ungulates, often
  attaining to large dimensions, are nearly peculiar, so far as is at
  present known, to the North American Continent, and are at least most
  abundant in it.<a name="NtA_167" href="#Nt_167"><sup>[167]</sup></a> Many
  generic names, such as <i>Titanotherium</i>, <i>Brontotherium</i>,
  <i>Brontops</i>, <i>Titanops</i>, and <i>Menodus</i>, have been given to
  them; but a recent study of the entire material accessible for
  description or already described has led Professor Osborn to the opinion
  that there was but a single genus, to which the name <i>Titanotherium</i>
  must be applied. Of this genus there are some thirty well-characterised
  species, of which the gradual evolution can be traced from the lowest
  strata of the White River beds where their remains occur. An entire
  skeleton of <i>T. robustum</i> enables us to understand the osteology of
  these forms and to compare them with other Perissodactyles. This animal
  was more than 13 feet long, standing some 7 feet 7 inches in height. It
  seems to have presented during life the aspect of a Rhinoceros with
  perhaps a touch of Elephant. The skull is not unlike that of a Rhinoceros
  in general dimensions and shape; but there are a pair of apparent horn
  cores anteriorly, which are smaller in the more ancient forms and acquire
  a large size, a forward direction with a divergence of the two in the
  later forms. A glance at the accompanying figures of skulls (Fig. 137) of
  early and later Titanotheres will exhibit the changes in this particular
  which the skulls underwent in the lapse of time occupied by the
  deposition of these Oligocene beds. The nasals are short in the later,
  longer in the more early species, such as <i>T. heloceras</i> and <i>T.
  coloradense</i>. The zygomatic arch projects much, and is "shelf-like" in
  the later forms, the skull thus getting an immense breadth, which,<a
  name="page265"></a> <!-- Page 266 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page266"></a>{266}</span>together with the long and divergent horn
  cores, must have given to the living animal a most bizarre appearance. It
  is an interesting fact that this animal, though a Perissodactyle, agrees
  with the Artiodactyla in the nineteen dorso-lumbar vertebrae, of which
  seventeen bear ribs.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:44%;">
      <a href="images/137.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/137.jpg"

  </div>
<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 137.&mdash;Three figures showing the cranial evolution of <i>Titanotherium</i>. Upper figure,
<i>T. trigonoceras</i>; middle figure, <i>T. elatum</i>; lower figure, <i>T. platyceras</i>. (After Osborn.)</p>

  <p>The genus further agrees with the Artiodactyles in the structure of
  the carpus. The toes of the fore-limb are four, those of the hind-limb
  three; but while the hind-limb is undoubtedly Perissodactyle in the
  arrangement of its component parts, the fore-limb shows a hint of an
  Artiodactyle mode of structure. This limb is paraxonic, the axis of the
  limb passing between the two middle digits. It may be that this genus
  represents more nearly than any other Perissodactyle or Artiodactyle the
  primitive stem from which both have diverged, though, of course, it is
  not old enough to be very near to the actual ancestor. The molar
  dentition is the typical one; the incisors seem to vary as to their
  presence or absence, and, if present, in their numbers. In comparing the
  older with the more recent forms it is noteworthy that there has been an
  increase of size exactly as there has been during the evolution of the
  Camels and some other groups of Ungulates. As already mentioned, the size
  of the horn cores also increases until it culminates in the extraordinary
  species, <i>T. platyceras</i> and <i>T. ramosum</i>, in which these are
  half as long as the skull, flattened in form, and connected at their
  bases by a "web" of bone. Arrived at this amount of specialisation the
  genus <i>Titanotherium</i> apparently exhausted its capacities for
  modification and ceased to be. The many generic names may be explained by
  sexual differences on the one hand and an incomplete knowledge of
  connecting links on the other.<a name="NtA_168"
  href="#Nt_168"><sup>[168]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Palaeosyops</i> is somewhat like a Tapir in build, the skull
  especially resembling that of the Tapir. As in <i>Titanotherium</i> the
  molar teeth, instead of having an outer wall formed by fused cusps, have
  a <img src="images/w.png" class="middle" style="height:2ex;" alt="W"
  />-shaped outer wall on one side and two or one cusps on the opposite
  side. It is, moreover, an Eocene form, and in correspondence with its
  greater age is more primitive in some points of structure, for example,
  in the absence of horns and in the full dental formula. The fore-limbs
  are four-toed, the hind <!-- Page 267 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page267"></a>{267}</span>three-toed. It was intermediate between a
  Tapir and a Rhinoceros in size. It has been shown, too, from casts of the
  interior of the skull, that the cerebral hemispheres are much less
  convoluted than were those of <i>Titanotherium</i>.</p>

  <p>Related to <i>Palaeosyops</i> is another primitive Titanothere, the
  genus <i>Telmatotherium</i>. This is also Eocene, from the Uinta Basin,
  the uppermost of Eocene strata. The skull of these creatures was rather
  elongated, and not unlike that of a Titanothere in general aspect. The
  dentition was complete and the canines not very large. The horns, which
  acquire so prodigious a development in the later Titanotheres, are just
  recognisable in at any rate many species of this genus
  <i>Telmatotherium</i>, the name being thus by no means an apt one. Better
  was that proposed by Dr. Wortman, of <i>Manteoceras</i> or "prophet
  horned." The horns are small elevations upon the frontals just at the
  junction of these with the nasals, and, indeed, lying partly upon the
  latter bones. In <i>T. cornutum</i> the horns are chiefly borne upon the
  very long nasals, whose size contrasts with the same bones in the more
  highly-developed <i>Titanotherium</i>. It appears to be quite possible
  that <i>Titanotherium</i> was evolved from the genus
  <i>Telmatotherium</i>.<a name="NtA_169"
  href="#Nt_169"><sup>[169]</sup></a></p>

<h5><span class="sc">Sub-Order 9.</span> LITOPTERNA.</h5>

  <p>Whether the <b>Macraucheniidae</b> should be considered as a separate
  group of Ungulata is a matter of dispute. Cope placed them in a special
  order of Ungulates which he called Litopterna. Zittel, on the other hand,
  regards them as definitely Perissodactyles. One curious point of
  resemblance to existing Horses is shown&mdash;that is the presence of a
  pit in the incisor teeth. This matter seems to be so important as to need
  a placing of these forms in the neighbourhood of the Perissodactyles,
  even of the Equidae; it is so peculiar a character, and apparently so
  little related to any obvious similarity in way of life, that it seems to
  mark a special affinity. Not so the fact that in <i>Macrauchenia</i> at
  any rate the orbit was entirely surrounded by bone as in the Horse. We
  find that condition so frequently acquired in many groups,&mdash;a
  development from an earlier condition where the cavity for the lodgment
  of the eye is in continuity with the temporal <!-- Page 268 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page268"></a>{268}</span>fossa, that it cannot
  be regarded as anything more than a mark of specialisation. It is, in
  fact, the case that the Macraucheniidae are in many points specialised,
  while retaining many primitive features of structure.</p>

  <p>The chief primitive features are: the non-alternating positions of the
  wrist- and ankle-bones; these, of course, interlock in the
  Perissodactyles of to-day and in many extinct families. Then the absence
  of a diastema in the tooth series, coupled with the presence in
  <i>Macrauchenia</i> of a complete dentition. The small brain may be
  referred to the same category. <i>Macrauchenia</i> must have been a
  strange-looking animal. It walked upon three toes on each limb; the skull
  was Horse-like in general form, but the nostrils are removed to a point
  about as far back as in the Whales or nearly so, the nasal bones being
  correspondingly reduced. This it is thought argues a proboscis. The
  humerus is particularly compared by Burmeister<a name="NtA_170"
  href="#Nt_170"><sup>[170]</sup></a> to that of a Horse. The radius and
  ulna though both well developed are fused. The neck is long, and, as in
  the Camel, the vertebral arteries run inside the neural arches. Since the
  fore-legs seem to have been rather longer than the hind-legs, though only
  very slightly, and the neck was long, the animal may have presented some
  likeness to the Giraffe. It is interesting to note that in the
  proportions of humerus to ulna this animal is more Lama-like than
  Horse-like. On the other hand, the proportions of femur to tibia are more
  Horse-like. The remains of the creature are limited to South America, and
  to quite superficial deposits. It is evidently a specialised type, and
  has pursued a course parallel to that of the Horse. Much nearer to the
  Horse however, but apparently by convergence only, is the genus
  <i>Thoatherium</i>, usually placed in a separate family, the
  <b>Protorotheriidae</b>. In this creature, which has many archaic
  characters, the toes are reduced to one in each foot. In an allied form,
  <i>Protorotherium</i>, we have the two lateral toes diminishing just as
  in <i>Anchitherium</i>.</p>

  <p>The Artiodactyle or "Even-toed" Ungulates are to be distinguished from
  the Perissodactyla, and from other Ungulate groups, by a number of
  trenchant characters. The most salient <!-- Page 270 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page270"></a>{270}</span>of these, and that
  which has given its name to the group, concerns the arrangement of the
  digits. Instead of there being but one prevailing digit&mdash;the third,
  in the hand and foot, through which the axis of the foot passes, there
  are two, numbers three and four, between which the same axis passes, and
  which are perfectly symmetrical with each other. This type of foot has
  been termed "paraxonic," as opposed to the "mesaxonic" Perissodactyle
  foot (see Fig. 121 B, p. <a href="#page235">235</a>). It has been
  attempted to prove that the single prevailing digit of the Horse's foot
  is a fused pair of digits, and the state of affairs which characterises
  the Camel, where the two metacarpals or metatarsals are to an almost
  complete extent united, has been urged in proof; so, too, certain
  abnormalities, such as those called "solid-hoofed pigs."<a name="NtA_171"
  href="#Nt_171"><sup>[171]</sup></a> These latter are simply Pigs in which
  the two central metacarpals and the terminal hoofs are completely fused
  with one another. In some of such cases there is not the slightest trace
  of the union of the separate metacarpals and phalanges. Even the sesamoid
  bones, attached behind to the toes, are two in number instead of four.
  And, furthermore, the tendon supplying the bones is single, though
  showing traces of its double origin. Such Pigs often show the abnormality
  from generation to generation, and they proved convenient for those whose
  scruples would not allow them to eat the flesh of a beast "dividing the
  hoof" and not chewing the cud. More singular still, as showing a
  pathological approach from another side to the Perissodactyle condition
  in an Artiodactyle, is a calf, where the foot ended in three equi-sized
  digits, of which the middle one lay in the longitudinal axis of the limb.
  From the opposite side cases are known of a Horse with a split hoof and
  phalanges, thus presenting the most striking likeness to a Camel.</p>

  <p>There is, furthermore, in certain groups of Artiodactyles (<i>e.g.</i>
  the Tragulidae) a tendency for the two middle metacarpals to unite, quite
  apart from such "sports" as those illustrated by the cases just set
  forth. And, as already mentioned, the union of the two middle metacarpals
  culminates in the Camel, Ox, etc. There is, however, absolutely no trace
  of such a fusion in the series of Perissodactyle animals known to us; and
  it would be by fusion rather than dismemberment that, as it would appear
  on this theory, the modern Ungulate foot has been arrived at. Of course
  <!-- Page 271 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page271"></a>{271}</span>the facts of Ungulate descent are
  absolutely destructive of any such comparisons.</p>

  <p>As is the case with the Perissodactyles, the Artiodactyles show a
  historical series, the primitive five-toed condition being almost
  preserved in <i>Oreodon</i>, up to the most modern modification
  exemplified by the Ox, Sheep, etc., in which animals there are not even
  vestiges of the fourth and fifth toes. It has been stated, however, that
  the foetal Sheep has traces of those rudiments. The so-called cannon bone
  (the fused third and fourth metapodia) is accompanied in its fusion by an
  increase in length. At the same time the functional middle metacarpals
  push aside the rudiments and, forming a broad surface for that purpose,
  articulate with the magnum and unciform bones to the exclusion of the
  rudiments. This has been termed an "adaptive reduction." In the
  "inadaptive reduction" there is the same reduction of the metacarpals,
  but the rudiments still articulate as in the primitive Artiodactyle foot,
  <i>i.e.</i> Mc II with trapezium, trapezoid, and magnum; Mc III with
  magnum and unciform; Mc IV and V with unciform. This would appear to give
  greater solidity and consequently greater strength to the foot.</p>

  <p>The carpal bones of the Artiodactyla alternate in their articulation;
  the primitive state of affairs<a name="NtA_172"
  href="#Nt_172"><sup>[172]</sup></a> is not retained even in the earliest
  types. The femur has no third trochanter, so prevalent in the
  Perissodactyles. In the hind-foot the calcaneum has an articular facet
  for the fibula, which is not characteristic of the Perissodactyla. In the
  more modern forms, <i>e.g.</i> the Cervidae, the navicular and cuboid
  become fused into one bone; and there are even further fusions which will
  be referred to later as characteristic features of different groups. It
  is interesting to notice that the reduction begins earlier and is clearer
  in the hind-foot than in the fore. One <!-- Page 272 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page272"></a>{272}</span>can see how this may be
  purely adaptive, the push of the hind-legs in running needing a firmer
  support. In <i>Hyomoschus</i> this is the case. The hind-limbs are
  provided with a cannon bone, while the metacarpals of the fore-feet are
  still free.</p>

  <p>The number of dorso-lumbar vertebrae is less in the Artiodactyle than
  in the Perissodactyle Ungulates. Whereas the former have but nineteen,
  the latter have, as a rule, twenty-three such vertebrae.<a name="NtA_173"
  href="#Nt_173"><sup>[173]</sup></a> The number of ribs varies from twelve
  (<i>Camelus</i>, <i>Hydropotes</i>) through thirteen (<i>Cervus</i>,
  <i>Gazella</i>) to fourteen in <i>Dicotyles</i>, <i>Giraffa</i>, etc.</p>

  <p>The curious form of teeth known as "selenodont" is characteristic of
  the Artiodactyla, though only found well developed in the modern forms,
  and of those only in the Pecora. The more primitive forms had "bunodont"
  teeth with typically four tubercles (if we except the tritubercular and
  but little-known <i>Pantolestes</i>); and the intermediate
  "buno-selenodont" type characterises such groups as the
  Anthracotheriidae.</p>

  <p>While the stomach of the Perissodactyles is always a simple sac, it is
  complicated, or shows signs of complication, in the Artiodactyles. That
  of the Hippopotamus is divided into two chambers; there are three in
  <i>Tragulus</i>, and four in the typical Ruminants such as <i>Cervus</i>,
  <i>Ovis</i>, etc.</p>

  <p>Had we to deal only with the still living genera of Artiodactyles, it
  would be easy to sort them into two groups on the characters of the
  teeth; for the Pigs and Hippopotamus are provided with tubercular molars;
  they are bunodont. The Deer, Camels, Oxen, Giraffes, etc., have
  selenodont molars. Besides, the latter are "Ruminants," and have a more
  complicated stomach. The existing Chevrotains forbid a more trenchant
  division, since they are, as will be pointed out in due course, somewhat
  intermediate in structure; the feet are more Pig-like, and the stomach is
  not so typically Ruminant. In any case such a division is prevented by
  certain extinct families which are perhaps ancestral to both. They have
  teeth which are not quite bunodont and not quite selenodont. These teeth
  have been termed buno-selenodont or buno-lophodont.</p>

  <p>The distribution of the living Artiodactyles presents us with some
  interesting facts. The vast preponderance of species occurs in the Old
  World&mdash;34 in America as against over 250 species <!-- Page 273
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page273"></a>{273}</span>in Europe,
  Asia, and Africa. The Neotropical region has no Oxen, or Sheep, or
  Antelopes. The latter are confined to Africa, Asia, and certain parts of
  the Palaearctic region; they are vastly more prevalent in Africa, where
  they take the place of the totally absent Deer. The Pig tribe is almost
  entirely Oriental and Ethiopian in distribution, only one form, the
  European Wild Boar, ranging into the Palaearctic region; and the two
  species of Peccary are found in both North and South America. Broadly
  speaking, the Ethiopian region is the headquarters of the Artiodactyla.
  But the great island of Madagascar has but one form of Artiodactyle, a
  Pig of the genus <i>Potamochoerus</i>.<a name="NtA_174"
  href="#Nt_174"><sup>[174]</sup></a></p>

<h5><span class="sc">Group I.</span>&mdash;<i>SUINA.</i></h5>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Hippopotamidae.</b>&mdash;The family Hippopotamidae
  contains of existing genera only <i>Hippopotamus</i>, for the Liberian
  dwarf Hippopotamus is not now regarded, as it was formerly, as the type
  of another genus, <i>Choeropsis</i>. The reasons for its former
  separation were the loss of the outer pair of incisors and the different
  proportions of various parts of the skull. This little Liberian animal
  has, however, been shown by Sir W. Flower<a name="NtA_175"
  href="#Nt_175"><sup>[175]</sup></a> to possess the missing incisors
  occasionally; and as to the proportions of the skull, it is exceedingly
  common for small animals to vary from larger relatives in this way.
  Hence, considering the characteristic features of the Hippopotamus and
  the fewness of species, it seems unnecessary to divide it up further. We
  shall therefore only recognise one genus.</p>

  <p>The Hippopotamus at present is African in range, and confined to that
  continent. But quite recently it inhabited Madagascar; and further back
  still in time the existing African species, <i>H. amphibius</i>, ranged
  into Europe; there were also Indian forms, which were contemporary with
  the Stone-age man. The Common Hippopotamus is a great thick-skinned beast
  with but few hairs. It has four toes on each foot, a complex stomach, but
  no caecum. The strong incisors continue growing through life, as do the
  great canines. The number of incisors is two on each side of each jaw.
  Some of the extinct species had six in each <!-- Page 274 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page274"></a>{274}</span>jaw, and they were
  distinguished as a genus <i>Hexaprotodon</i>, contrasting with
  <i>Tetraprotodon</i>, until intermediate conditions were observed.
  <i>Choeropsis</i>, as already observed, was a still further reduction of
  the tetraprotodont type. The molars (the formula is Pm&nbsp;4/4 M&nbsp;3/3) when
  worn show a double trefoil pattern. The orbital cavity is encircled by
  bone. As with many other aquatic mammals the kidneys are lobulated.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:43%;">
      <a href="images/140.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/140.jpg"

  <p>A very singular fact about the Hippopotamus is the production of a
  "bloody sweat," a carmine-coloured secretion, containing small crystals
  and corpuscles, from the skin. This coloured fluid has of course nothing
  to do with blood.<a name="NtA_176"
  href="#Nt_176"><sup>[176]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The animal grows to a length of at any rate 14 feet. The limbs and the
  tail are short. Like other aquatic animals the nostrils are on the
  surface of the head, and can be closed when the animal is under water.
  When it reaches the surface of the water after a prolonged immersion, it
  spouts like a Whale. Sir Samuel Baker says that ten minutes is the
  longest time that the Hippopotamus can remain below the water. It is
  frequently a dangerous animal to encounter, as it will capsize boats, and
  even bite large pieces out of their bottoms; with its huge teeth it <!--
  Page 275 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page275"></a>{275}</span>can
  and does attack and destroy human beings. The Hippopotamus not only
  swims, but can walk along the bottom of a river with great rapidity. It
  occasionally puts out to sea from the mouths of rivers frequented by it;
  and it is supposed that in this way Madagascar was populated with
  Hippopotamuses, whose remains are now found in swamps in that island.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Suidae.</b>&mdash;The Pig family, Suidae, differ from the
  last in their smaller size, in the terminal nostrils and mobile snout,
  which is not grooved, except faintly as in <i>Babirusa</i>. They are
  generally hairy, but the Babyroussa is an exception, while
  <i>Phacochoerus</i> is but slightly haired. Though there are four digits,
  as in the Hippopotamus, only two reach the ground in walking. The
  stomach, furthermore, is simple, and (except in <i>Dicotyles</i>) there
  is a caecum. The kidneys are smooth, and the liver is more lobate than in
  <i>Hippopotamus</i>. The orbital cavity is confluent with the temporal
  fossa. The typical genus, <i>Sus</i>, is distributed over Europe, Asia,
  and the islands of the Malay Archipelago, reaching as far as Borneo and
  Celebes. The dentition<a name="NtA_177"
  href="#Nt_177"><sup>[177]</sup></a> is complete. A single species, the
  so-called <i>S. sennaariensis</i>, is from Ethiopian Africa, but it is
  not certain how far this animal may be an escaped species introduced by
  man. A very large number of "species" of <i>Sus</i> have been described,
  but Dr. Forsyth <!-- Page 276 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page276"></a>{276}</span>Major is disposed to reduce them to four
  if not to fewer species. He allows the widely-ranging <i>S. scrofa</i>,
  <i>S. vittatus</i>, and the eastern Malayan <i>S. verrucosus</i> and
  <i>S. barbatus</i>.</p>

  <p>The Pygmy Hog of the Bhotans seems to be not entitled to specific
  rank, certainly not to generic (in the opinion of some), though it has
  been termed <i>Porcula salvania</i>.<a name="NtA_178"
  href="#Nt_178"><sup>[178]</sup></a> The Wild Boar of Europe is <i>Sus

  are its remains exhumed from fens, caves and peat bogs, but there is
  ample evidence of its continuance down to a comparatively late historic
  period. Enactments are on record as to the hunting of these animals;
  there are places, such as Boarstall, whose names are clearly derived from
  the name of the animal, presumably once a native of the locality; and
  various documents all show the presence of the Wild Boar <!-- Page 277

  <p>The African Wart Hog, genus <i>Phacochoerus</i>, is usually regarded
  as the type of a distinct genus of Pigs. This animal, "superlatively
  ugly" with its huge tusks and great protuberances upon the face, is
  chiefly to be distinguished from the genus <i>Sus</i> by these
  characters, and by the complexity of the last molar, which, with the
  tusks, are sometimes in aged animals the only teeth left. The complete
  formula is Pm&nbsp;2/2 M&nbsp;3/3. There are two species of this genus, <i>P.
  aethiopicus</i> and <i>P. africanus</i>. When enraged the Wart Hog is
  said to carry its tail directly up, and to present a ludicrous as well as
  ferocious appearance.</p>

<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 144.&mdash;Head of Wart Hog.</p>

  <p>The Celebesian Babyroussa, genus <i>Babirusa</i>, is an almost
  hairless hog with enormously upturned tusks in both jaws of the <!-- Page
  278 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page278"></a>{278}</span>male. In
  the Wild Boar there is a hint of this, which is carried still further in
  <i>Phacochoerus</i>; but in <i>Babirusa</i> the upper tusks turn upwards
  before they leave the substance of the jaw, for which reason they appear
  to arise on its dorsal surface; the lower tusks are nearly as long. It
  has been found that the young of this Pig are not striped as are those of
  other Pigs. By means of the curved upper tusks this animal has been said
  by old writers to suspend itself to branches of trees, just as does by
  his downwardly-projecting tusks the male Chevrotain! There is but one
  species, <i>B. alfurus</i>.</p>

  <p>From <i>Sus</i> proper the African and Malagasy <i>Potamochoerus</i>,
  including the Red River Hog, is barely separable generically. Their
  principal claim to generic distinction lies in the existence of a horny
  outgrowth arising from a bony apophysis above the canine in the male.
  These have been compared to the osseous "horn cores" in the extinct
  Dinocerata. But the Javan <i>Sus verrucosus</i> shows at least the
  beginning of a similar modification. The popular name of the animal is
  derived from the fine rufous colour of its pelage, not seen, however, in
  all the species. Dr. Forsyth Major<a name="NtA_179"
  href="#Nt_179"><sup>[179]</sup></a> recognises five species, of which
  only one is from Madagascar.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Dicotylidae.</b>&mdash;The Peccaries are generally placed
  in a different family from that of the other Pigs. This family, <!-- Page
  279 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page279"></a>{279}</span>Dicotylidae, contains but one genus,
  <i>Dicotyles</i>, with at most two species. The name of the animal is
  connected with the dorsal gland; the animal thus appeared to possess two
  navels. The Peccaries, exclusively confined to the New World, differ from
  the Old-World Pigs in one or more important characters. They have only
  three toes on the hind-feet, and the stomach is complicated. Though the
  Peccaries have but small tusks they hunt in packs and are very dangerous
  animals to meet with. They owe, too, their safety from many foes to their
  sociable habits. Being nocturnal animals they are liable to the attacks
  of the Jaguar, which will speedily overpower and devour a Peccary that
  has strayed from its herd.</p>

  <p><b>Fossil Swine.</b>&mdash;The existing genera of the Pig tribe are
  also known in a fossil condition. <i>Sus</i> itself goes back as far as
  the Upper Miocene. <i>Sus erymanthius</i>, the Erymanthine Boar, is known
  from beds of that age in Greece, England, and Germany. This genus is not
  known to have had a wider distribution in the past than it has in the
  present. <i>Dicotyles</i> occurs in the Pleistocene of both North and
  South America, the regions which it inhabits at the present day. The
  genus <i>Listriodon</i>, also Miocene, is remarkable for having lophodont
  instead of bunodont teeth, that is so far as concerns the molars, which
  resemble those of the Tapir. It was European and Indian in range. A
  number of genera, more remote from the existing Pigs than those which
  have just been dealt with, are placed together in a special sub-family,
  Achaenodontinae. The type genus, <i>Achaenodon</i>, had a somewhat short
  skull for a Pig; and it is in general aspect and in the characters of the
  canine teeth highly suggestive of that of a Carnivore. The bunodont
  molars, however, are Suine, as is the form of the lower jaw with a
  rounded angle. This is an Eocene animal found in Wyoming.</p>

  <p><i>Elotherium</i><a name="NtA_180" href="#Nt_180"><sup>[180]</sup></a>
  occurs chiefly in the Miocene of both North America and Europe; but <i>E.
  uintense</i> is Eocene. The orbits are completely encircled by bone in
  the more modern forms; this is not the case in the last-described genus,
  with which <i>E. uintense</i> agrees. The skull is also longer and more
  Pig-like. The zygomatic arch is powerful, with sometimes a large
  descending process, such as is found in <i>Diprotodon</i>, more faintly
  in Kangaroos, and in Sloths and certain extinct Edentates. The lower jaw
  has a pair <!-- Page 280 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page280"></a>{280}</span>of dependent processes near the symphysis,
  which suggest processes occupying a corresponding position in
  <i>Dinoceras</i>. The skull and body are heavy, but the two-toed limbs
  are slender. There is a smaller pair of toes behind these. The dentition
  is complete, and the canines are not inordinately developed. The brain is
  very diminutive. Perhaps <i>E. uintense</i> should be separated as a
  distinct genus, <i>Protelotherium</i>.<a name="NtA_181"
  href="#Nt_181"><sup>[181]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Hyotherium</i> (which is regarded as identical with
  <i>Palaeochoerus</i>) has a sharp sagittal crest; the orbit is nearly but
  not quite closed. The canines are not strongly developed. The upper
  canines have double fangs as in <i>Triconodon</i> among extinct mammals,
  and as in the Hedgehog and other forms among living Mammalia. The
  premolars have the cutting and serrated edge of those of some other Pigs,
  a feature which gives them a curious resemblance to the "grinding" teeth
  of Seals. The molars are tuberculate, and like those of living Pigs. It
  is European and Indian in range, and Miocene.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Choeropotamus</i> has a complete dental formula save for
  the loss of a premolar in the lower jaw. Though it has lost this tooth,
  it is from an older stratum than some of those forms which have retained
  that premolar; it has been found in the Upper Eocene of the Isle of Wight
  and of the neighbourhood of Paris.</p>

  <p>The American and Miocene <i>Chaenohyus</i> has lost the corresponding
  teeth of the upper jaw.</p>

  <p><i>Homacodon</i><a name="NtA_182" href="#Nt_182"><sup>[182]</sup></a>
  is a genus consisting of several species, which has a bunodont and
  complete dentition. The molars are sextubercular in the upper jaw. <i>H.
  vagans</i> was of about the size of a Rabbit, and it appears to have had
  a curved neck. The limbs had five digits, as is so generally the case
  with Eocene Ungulates. It is known from the Middle Eocene of Wyoming.</p>

<h5><span class="sc">Group II.</span>&mdash;<i>RUMINANTIA.</i></h5>

  <p>The Selenodontia or Ruminantia form the second division of existing
  Artiodactyles. The characters of the teeth, which give them their name,
  have already been referred to. They also differ in that there are never
  more than a single pair of incisors <!-- Page 281 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page281"></a>{281}</span>in the upper jaw, and
  very usually there are none. As a general rule the third and fourth
  metacarpals and metatarsals become united to form a cannon bone. To this
  there is but one exception, the African <i>Hyomoschus</i>. Moreover, the
  second and fifth digits are nearly always rudimentary, and may
  practically disappear altogether. Here again the Tragulidae are an
  exception. The Ruminantia are so-called on account of the fact that they
  "ruminate," that is, after the food has been rapidly swallowed, it is
  forced back up the gullet and more thoroughly masticated. Associated with
  this is a complex stomach, which is divided into several compartments.
  This stomach has at least three compartments, as in the Tragulidae; but
  it has usually four. Its characters are illustrated in Fig. 146. The
  majority of the Selenodontia possess horns, which are partly formed of
  solid protuberances of the frontal bones. In the Giraffe they are
  somewhat different.</p>

  <p>This group may be divided into&mdash;A. <span
  class="sc">Tragulina</span>, Chevrotains; B. <span
  class="sc">Tylopoda</span>, Camels, Lamas; and C. <span
  class="sc">Pecora</span>, Deer, Antelopes, Oxen, Giraffes, Goats,
  Sheep.</p>

<h5>A. <b>TRAGULINA.</b></h5>

  <p>As the Tragulina are undoubtedly the most ancient of the Selenodontia
  it will be logical to commence with an account of them. <!-- Page 282
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page282"></a>{282}</span></p>

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Tragulidae.</b>&mdash;This family comprises a number of
  small Deer-like animals, which are really in many points more related to
  the Pigs than to the true Deer. They are known as Chevrotains; and the
  term "Deerlet," introduced by Professor Garrod, is certainly appropriate,
  since they have the aspect of very small and hornless Deer. If it were
  not for their Artiodactyle feet one might at a glance confuse these
  creatures with some Marsupial type. The family is Oriental and West
  African in range. The two genera (whose individual peculiarities will be
  considered later) differ from other Artiodactyles in a number of rather
  important characters.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:42%;">
      <a href="images/147.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/147.jpg"

  </div>
<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 147.&mdash;Indian Chevrotain. <i>Tragulus meminna.</i> × ¼.</p>

  <p>They are absolutely hornless in both sexes. The canines are present in
  both jaws, and are especially well developed in the upper jaw. The dental
  formula is I&nbsp;0/3 C&nbsp;1/1 Pm&nbsp;3/3 M&nbsp;3/3. In the skull the tympanic bulla is
  usually, as in the non-ruminating Artiodactyles, filled with loose bony
  tissue. The feet (usually) have the four toes of the Suina, and are
  therefore in a more primitive condition than in Deer and Antelopes. But
  as the middle metacarpals are fused in <i>Tragulus</i> (though separate
  in <i>Hyomoschus</i>) they are a stage further than are the Pigs, in the
  direction of the typical Ruminants.</p>

  <p>The stomach is comparatively simple, thus offering <!-- Page 283
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page283"></a>{283}</span>intermediate
  characters between the Pigs and the Ruminants; there are but three
  separate compartments. A highly-interesting character is afforded by the
  placenta. This is in the present family of the diffuse kind, not
  presenting the separated and tufted cotyledons of the Ruminant placenta.
  This we may fairly assume is a further proof of the less-specialised
  characters of this group<a name="NtA_183"
  href="#Nt_183"><sup>[183]</sup></a> as compared with the Ruminantia, a
  view, however, which is not universally accepted. While the molars have
  the selenodont character of other Pecora, the premolars are more adapted
  for cutting, with sharp edges.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Tragulus</i> consists of several species (e.g. <i>T.
  stanleyanus</i>, <i>T. napu</i>, etc.), which have been aptly compared in
  external appearance to certain Rodents such as the Agoutis. The legs are
  delicate and slender, hardly "thicker than an ordinary cedar pencil."
  These creatures have got among the Malays a considerable reputation for
  astuteness, embodied in the saying, "Cunning as a <i>kanchil</i>." The
  male has tusks, which greatly contributed to the confusion of this
  creature with the totally different Musk Deer, <i>Moschus
  moschiferus</i>. It is even said to suspend itself by their aid to the
  branches of trees, and so avoid danger.</p>

  <p><i>Hyomoschus</i> (or <i>Dorcatherium</i> as it should properly be
  called) is West African. Its rich brown colour, with spots and stripes,
  is much like that of the Chevrotains, but it has shorter limbs. The only
  species is <i>D. aquaticum</i>, which is sometimes called, on account of
  its frequenting the banks of streams, the Water Chevrotain. Remains of
  this genus occur in Miocene and Pliocene strata of Europe.</p>

  <p>The separate metacarpals, comparatively simple stomach, absence of
  horns, diffuse placenta, and spotted pelage are features which argue the
  primitive position of these animals among existing Artiodactyles.</p>

  <p>Besides the two existing genera which have just been treated of, there
  are a number of extinct genera undoubtedly belonging to the same
  group.</p>

  <p><i>Gelocus</i> (Eocene and Oligocene in range) is a European genus
  known from France. It differs from the living members of the group by the
  fact that the second and fifth toes on both hind- and fore-feet are
  represented, as in certain Deer, <!-- Page 284 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page284"></a>{284}</span>by rudiments at the
  upper and at the lower end only; they are deficient in the middle. The
  middle large metacarpals, though closely applied, are not fused. The
  metatarsals, on the other hand, are, or are not fused, according to the
  species. A later form is the genus <i>Leptomeryx</i> from the Miocene of
  North America. This genus departs from the typical Traguline structure in
  more than one point. The tympanic bulla is hollow instead of being filled
  with cancellated bone; the cuneiform is not fused with the cuboid and
  navicular, though the latter are with each other; the lateral digits of
  the hind-feet are rudimentary. The magnum and trapezoid, however, are
  fused. In the fore-feet the middle metacarpals are separate, and the
  lateral less perfect metacarpals have toes. The metatarsals are
  fused.</p>

  <p>Not definitely referable to the Tragulidae, but coming near to them,
  are the <b>Protoceratidae</b>. Of this family there is but one well-known
  genus, <i>Protoceras</i>,<a name="NtA_184"
  href="#Nt_184"><sup>[184]</sup></a> from the Miocene of North
  America.</p>

  <p>The skull is singularly reminiscent of <i>Dinoceras</i>, with which
  this quite Artiodactyle genus has, of course, nothing to do. It merely
  exemplifies the phenomenon of "parallelism." In general form it is
  peculiarly long and low. There are three pairs of bony protuberances:
  one, the largest, pair are situated on the maxillae rising up just behind
  the implantation of the canine teeth; the parietals have a second pair;
  and a third much more diminutive pair of bosses are upon the frontals,
  near their junction with the nasals. This description refers to the male;
  the female has only traces of the parietal bosses. These were all
  possibly tipped or sheathed with horn or roughened skin. The dentition of
  this genus is precisely that of the Tragulidae, <i>i.e.</i> I&nbsp;0/3 C&nbsp;1/1
  Pm&nbsp;4/4 M&nbsp;3/3. The orbit is completely encircled by bone; the auditory
  bulla is not swollen; the premaxillae are small.</p>

  <p>The nasal cavity is very large and open, the end of the nasal bones
  anteriorly being situated at about the middle of the skull; this would
  seem to indicate at least a flexible and long nose like that of the Saiga
  Antelope, if not a trunk.</p>

  <p>The brain was of good size, and quite well convoluted.</p>

  <p>The limbs are constituted on the Traguline plan; in the fore-limbs the
  middle metacarpals are quite free from each other, and the more
  diminutive lateral digits are complete. The <!-- Page 285 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page285"></a>{285}</span>metatarsals are free,
  but with a tendency to fusion; the lateral toes are only represented at
  the upper extremity. The carpal bones are separated.</p>

  <p>This animal, which was about the size of a Sheep, though of more
  delicate proportions, was allied not only to the Tragulidae but to the
  Giraffidae; it is impossible to refer it definitely to either family.</p>

<h5>B. <b>TYLOPODA.</b></h5>

  <p><b>Fam. 5. Camelidae.</b>&mdash;This small group of Selenodonts
  includes only the Camels and Lamas. The limbs are long and have no traces
  of the second and fifth toes. The fused metacarpals and metatarsals
  diverge somewhat at their distal ends. In the upper jaw is a single pair
  of incisors. The stomach differs from that of the typical Ruminants. The
  rumen has smooth and not papillose walls, and from it are developed the
  "water cells," diverticula with narrow mouths provided with a closing
  sphincter muscle. The psalterium is reduced to a mere vestige, and so the
  stomach has, as in the Tragulina, but three chambers. This, so far
  ancient, character in the structure of the Camel tribe is associated with
  another, also seen in the more primitive Ungulates, viz. the diffuse
  character of the placenta. A very singular peculiarity of this group is
  the fact that the blood corpuscles instead of showing the ordinary
  mammalian round contours are elliptical.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Camelus</i>, confined to the Old World, is made up of two
  quite distinct species, the Bactrian Camel, <i>C. bactrianus</i>, with
  two humps, and the Dromedary, <i>C. dromedarius</i>, with only one. The
  former species is Asiatic. It is a singular fact that neither of the
  species is known to occur in a genuinely wild condition. The so-called
  "wild" Camels appear to be invariably feral. The two species will
  interbreed; and there is at the Zoological Society's Gardens such a
  hybrid, which has the general appearance and shaggy brown hair<a
  name="NtA_185" href="#Nt_185"><sup>[185]</sup></a> of the Bactrian
  animal, but the one hump of the Dromedary. It may be that the Bactrian
  Camels of Lob-nor are really wild; but the desert contains so many
  remains of cities destroyed by sand-storms that these reputed wild <!--
  Page 286 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page286"></a>{286}</span>Camels may be the descendants of animals
  belonging to the inhabitants of those cities. A strayed herd of Camels
  has established itself in a feral state in Spain. Otherwise the genus
  does not occur in Europe. The Camels are also represented in the New
  World. The genus <i>Lama</i> (<i>Auchenia</i> of many authors) belongs to
  this family. These Camels differ from their allies in the Old World by
  their smaller size, by the absence of the characteristic hump, and by the
  dropping of one premolar, the dental formula being otherwise similar. A
  variety of names, Lama, Alpaca, Huanaco, Vicuña, have been applied to
  these animals; but it appears that the names are in excess of the number
  of the species. Mr. Thomas, who has lately inquired into the matter, will
  only allow two, the Huanaco, <i>Lama huanacos</i>, of which there are two
  domestic races, the Llama and the Alpaca, and the Vicuña, <i>Lama
  vicugna</i>. They are both South American in range. Not only is there a
  herd of escaped Camels in Spain, but the Spaniards attempted to introduce
  and acclimatise the useful Lama. The first Lama ever seen in Europe was
  brought in the year 1558 to <!-- Page 287 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page287"></a>{287}</span>the town of Middelburg in Holland; it was
  purchased and presented to the Emperor of Germany. Gesner gives a curious
  figure of it, representing the animal as a comparatively colossal beast
  submitting itself to the guidance of a dwarfish man. The habit of
  "spitting" of the Lama is well known. Augustin de Zarate and Buffon speak
  of the Lama as having no protection save this habit, which is more than a
  mere ejection of saliva: the contents of the stomach are forcibly shot at
  the object of its annoyance. It can also kick and bite. In the intestines
  (as in those of some other mammals) are found Bezoar stones, or Bezards
  as they are variously spelt. These were once valued in medicine, and even
  so lately as 1847 were, according to Gay, the historian of Chili, in
  vogue; these concretions, comparable to the ambergris of the Whales, were
  supposed to be an antidote to poison.</p>

  <p><b>Extinct Camels.</b>&mdash;The earliest cameloid type is the genus
  <i>Protylopus</i>,<a name="NtA_186" href="#Nt_186"><sup>[186]</sup></a>
  of which we are acquainted with an imperfect skull <!-- Page 288 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page288"></a>{288}</span>and the greater part of
  a radius and ulna belonging to one individual, and most portions of the
  hind-limbs in other specimens. The one species, <i>P. petersoni</i>, was
  about the size of a "jack rabbit," and is late Eocene (Uinta formation)
  and American in range. The teeth of this mammal are the typical
  forty-four, and the canines are not pronounced, being incisiform in
  shape. In the skull the nasals overhang, as in the genus
  <i>Poebrotherium</i>. The orbit is not closed by bone. There is in this
  ancient Camel a trace of the supra-orbital notch so characteristic of the
  Camel tribe. "The vertebrae resemble those of the modern Lamas closely in
  their general proportions." The lumbars have the usually Cameloid formula
  of 7. This genus has but two functional toes on the hind-feet, the second
  and fifth being reduced to vestiges. It is interesting to note that the
  radius and ulna appear to remain distinct, except in very old animals, in
  which they come to be co-ossified in the middle only, thus foreshadowing
  their complete union in the next genus, <i>Poebrotherium</i>. The present
  genus, moreover, as well as <i>Poebrotherium</i>, was distinctly
  unguligrade; it has not acquired the characteristic phalangigrade mode of
  progression of the modern types of Camels.</p>

  <p>The American and Oligocene <i>Poebrotherium</i> has been recently and
  exhaustively studied by Professor Scott.<a name="NtA_187"
  href="#Nt_187"><sup>[187]</sup></a> It was considerably smaller than a
  Lama. Its neck was long as compared with other Artiodactyles, but still
  shorter than that of the Lama. It was a lightly-built, graceful creature,
  with apparently some external likeness to a Lama. It is an important fact
  to notice that at this <!-- Page 289 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page289"></a>{289}</span>period, and for a long time after, there
  were no types referable to the Camelidae in the Old World. Though a Camel
  in many features of its organisation, <i>Poebrotherium</i> was
  "generalised" in many ways. Thus the metacarpals and metatarsals were not
  fused to form a cannon bone, and the two lateral digits were represented
  by splint rudiments of metacarpals and metatarsals. The dentition was
  complete. The skull though distinctly Tylopodan, also shows more
  generalised characters. Thus the orbit is not quite, though nearly,
  completed by bone. In the Camel it is quite closed. The nasal bones are
  much longer, reaching nearly to the end of the snout. The odontoid
  process of the axis vertebra is not spout-like as in existing forms, but
  cylindrical, though slightly flattened upon the upper surface. The
  scapula is described as being more like that of the Lama than of the
  Camel, though variations occur which approximate to the Camel. The brain,
  judging of course from casts, has those sulci "which are common to the
  whole series of Ungulates, and closely resemble those of a foetal
  Sheep."</p>

(From Flower's <i>Osteology</i>.)</p>

  <p>Later in historical sequence than <i>Poebrotherium</i>, and
  structurally intermediate between it and <i>Protolabis</i>, is the
  Miocene genus <i>Gomphotherium</i>. It shows an advance in structure upon
  <i>Poebrotherium</i>, in that the orbit is completely encircled by bone,
  though the posterior wall is thin; the lower canines instead of being
  incisiform are curved back as in later Camels, and separated by a wide
  diastema from the preceding and the succeeding teeth.</p>

  <p>Later in age than <i>Poebrotherium</i> is <i>Protolabis</i>, a
  <i>Tylopod</i> in which the full number of teeth is still retained; its
  skull presents no particular changes from the Poebrotherine type; the
  nasals, however, are somewhat shortened.</p>

  <p>Later still in point of time is <i>Procamelus</i>. In this form we
  have apparently an ancestral stock, whence both Camels and Lamas were
  derived. The upper incisors are as in existing forms, but the first and
  second persist for a somewhat longer time. The skull shows two
  well-marked types of structure; in <i>P. occidentalis</i> <!-- Page 290
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page290"></a>{290}</span>there are more
  points of likeness to the Lama, in <i>P. angustidens</i> to the Camel. In
  both, the orbits are completely encircled by bone. The nasals are much
  shortened. The odontoid process of the axis is still more concave than in
  <i>Poebrotherium</i>, but not spout-like as in existing forms. This fact
  shows that the spout-like character of the Camels' odontoid process is
  not a point of affinity to other Artiodactyles&mdash;in fact the
  occurrence of the same form of odontoid process in Perissodactyles is
  enough proof of this. We must come to the conclusion that the form is
  adaptive in all cases. If we were not obliged on palaeontological
  evidence to come to this conclusion, the structure in question is just
  one which would be fastened upon as evidence of genetic affinity; for it
  is a resemblance in a small though distinctive point of structure having
  no obvious relation to utility. The metacarpals and metatarsals have
  coalesced to form the cannon bones, though a rudiment of one metacarpal
  seems to remain. The genera referred to appear to be on the direct line
  of descent of the modern representatives of the family. But there are
  other forms which are offshoots of the main stem. Such are
  <i>Homocamelus</i>, <i>Eschatia</i>, and <i>Holomeniscus</i>. The last
  two are Pliocene and American; the teeth are much reduced.</p>

<h5>C. <b>PECORA.</b></h5>

  <p>The Pecora are a group which possess so many characters in common that
  it is not an easy task further to subdivide them.</p>

  <p>In all there are but two functional digits on the feet, and the
  metacarpals and metatarsals of these are fused. There are no upper
  incisors, and canines in the upper jaw are not universal, and generally
  small. Horns are confined to this group of the Selenodontia.<a
  name="NtA_188" href="#Nt_188"><sup>[188]</sup></a> The premolar teeth are
  of a simpler form than the molars. The stomach has four chambers, of
  which two may be regarded as belonging to its cardiac half and two to the
  pyloric. The former are, in the first place, a large paunch or rumen,
  followed by a smaller reticulum, so called on account of the network
  arrangement of the folds of its lining membrane. Connected with the
  latter, and constituting the first part of the pyloric half of the
  stomach, is the psalterium or "manyplies," so called on account of the
  longitudinal folds, like the leaves of a <!-- Page 291 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page291"></a>{291}</span>book, into which its
  lining membrane is raised. Finally there is the abomasum, out of which
  proceeds the small intestine. Garrod has observed that the chamber of the
  stomach which varies most among the Pecora is the psalterium. This
  chamber is specially large in <i>Bos</i>, and particularly small in the
  Antelopes <i>Nannotragus</i> and <i>Cephalophus</i>. But its variation
  relates more especially to the folds of its mucous membrane. These folds
  are of varying lengths and have a definite arrangement There may be as
  many as five sets of laminae of regular depths. The most simple
  psalterium is that of <i>Cephalophus</i>, where there are only two sets
  of laminae of different sizes, a deeper set and a very much shallower
  set; this form is termed by Garrod "duplicate." Most common is the
  "quadruplicate" arrangement, with four sets of laminae of differing
  depths. In all Pecora the liver is but little divided by fissures.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 6. Cervidae.</b>&mdash;The Deer tribe is a very extensive one,
  and, with the exception of Africa and Australia, world-wide in
  distribution.<a name="NtA_189" href="#Nt_189"><sup>[189]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The Deer are absolutely distinguished from all other Ruminant animals
  by the existence of antlers, which are invariably present in the male
  sex, save in the aberrant genera <i>Moschus</i> and <i>Hydropotes</i>; in
  the Reindeer alone are antlers present in both sexes. The general
  characters of these appendages have been dealt with on a former page (p.
  <a href="#page200">200</a>), where they are compared to, or rather
  contrasted with, the horns of the Bovidae. These antlers, so
  characteristic of the Cervidae, are very variously developed among the
  members of the family. Thus in <i>Elaphodus</i> the antlers are very
  small and entirely unbranched. In the Muntjacs, <i>Cervulus</i>, the
  antlers are hardly larger, but they have a small anterior branch arising
  from near the pedicel, the "brow tine." In <i>Cariacus antisiensis</i>
  only one branch, the brow tine, is present, but it is nearly as long as
  the main stem of the antler, the "beam." In <i>Capreolus capraea</i> the
  beam bears two tines; in <i>Cervus sika</i> three; in <i>C. duvauceli</i>
  two of the three tines present bear secondary branches. There are other
  complications (some of which are illustrated in Figs. 152-157) of the
  simple antler which culminate in the complex antlers with their expanded
  "palms" of the Elk and the Fallow Deer. <!-- Page 292 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page292"></a>{292}</span></p>

  <p>Another highly-interesting fact concerning these same antlers is their
  gradual increase in complexity of tines and palm from the Miocene
  <i>Cervus matheroni</i> to the great Irish Elk of post-Tertiary
  times.</p>

  <p>Beyond the antlers there seems to be no character of universal
  applicability which distinguishes the Cervidae from the nearly-related
  Antelopes. There are, however, a number of structural features which are
  <i>nearly</i> universally characteristic. Excepting <i>Moschus</i> (which
  Professor Garrod would not allow to be a "Deer"), no Cervine has a
  gall-bladder<a name="NtA_190" href="#Nt_190"><sup>[190]</sup></a> to its
  liver. All Bovidae (including Antelopes) have, with the exception of
  <i>Cephalophus</i>.</p>

  <p>A small but constant character of the Deer is the existence of two
  orifices to the lachrymal duct. The genus <i>Tragelaphus</i> alone among
  Antelopes shows this character.</p>

  <p>So far as is known the placenta of the Deer has but few cotyledons,
  that of the Bovidae many. But not many types are known.</p>

  <p>The navicular, cuboid and ectocuneiform are often united. This is
  never the case in the Bovidae.</p>

  <p>The first and second phalanges of the lateral (imperfectly developed)
  digits are always present except in the Muntjacs; they are never found in
  Bovidae. The Deer always present a light brown to a darker brown
  coloration. <i>Elaphodus michianus</i> is almost black. There is commonly
  white on the under parts and beneath the short tail. Some Deer, such as
  the Fallow Deer, are spotted; and the young of others that are uniformly
  coloured when adult are spotted. In some cases a winter coat, darker than
  the summer coat, is developed.</p>

  <p>Altogether some sixty species of Deer are known, of which the
  preponderance are Old-World forms. The Deer of the Old World are
  distributed among the genera<a name="NtA_191"
  href="#Nt_191"><sup>[191]</sup></a> <i>Cervus</i> (all Europe and Asia);
  <i>Cervulus</i>, the Muntjacs (India, Burmah, China, etc.);
  <i>Hydropotes</i> (Eastern China); <i>Capreolus</i> (Europe and Central
  Asia); <i>Elaphodus</i> (Eastern China); there is one American
  <i>Cervus</i>, the Wapiti. The American genera are <i>Cariacus</i> and
  <i>Pudua</i>. The Elk (<i>Alces</i>) and the Reindeer (<i>Rangifer</i>)
  are circumpolar. The principal structural modification which occurs
  within <!-- Page 293 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page293"></a>{293}</span>the family Cervidae concerns the
  rudimentary fifth and second toes. In <i>Capreolus</i>,
  <i>Hydropotes</i>, <i>Moschus</i>, <i>Alces</i>, <i>Rangifer</i>, and
  <i>Pudua</i> there are considerable remains of the lower parts of
  metacarpals II. and V.; in the other genera smaller traces of the upper
  ends of the same bones.</p>

  <p>The two most abnormal genera are <i>Moschus</i> and <i>Hydropotes</i>,
  more particularly the former, which neither Sir V. Brooke nor Professor
  Garrod allow to be members of the family at all. <i>Moschus</i> is
  usually placed in a special sub-family by itself, Moschinae, the
  remaining Deer being referred to another sub-family, Cervinae.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 1. Cervinae.</b>&mdash;The genus <i>Cervus</i> comprises
  rather over twenty existing species, which, except the Wapiti (<i>C.
  canadensis</i>), are exclusively Old World in distribution. The principal
  features of variation in the genus, in accordance with which it has been
  divided up into sub-genera, are (1) palmated (Fallow Deer, <i>Dama</i>)
  or non-palmated antlers; (2) adults spotted with white at all ages and
  seasons (<i>Axis</i>), or in summer only (<i>Pseudaxis</i>), or not at
  all; (3) spotted or unspotted young; (4) existence or absence of
  rudimentary canines in the upper jaw.</p>

  <p>Among the members of this genus, <i>Cervus (Elaphurus) davidianus</i>
  is interesting as having been first observed by the missionary Père David
  in a park belonging to the Emperor of China near Pekin. Its horns are
  remarkable for dividing early into two branches of equal length, of which
  the anterior again branches into two. Specimens of this Deer were
  ultimately obtained for the Zoological Society's Gardens.</p>

  <p>The species of <i>Cervus</i> are fairly distributed between the
  Palaearctic and the Indian regions. The Palaearctic species, such as
  Lühdorff's Deer (Fig. 152), are mainly Asiatic. <i>Cervus elaphus</i> and
  <i>Cervus dama</i> alone are European and British. The former of course
  is the Red Deer, the latter the Fallow Deer. The Red Deer is
  reddish-brown in summer and greyish-brown in winter, with the white patch
  on the rump so common in the Deer tribe. The Red Deer is genuinely wild
  in Scotland, in certain parts of Devonshire and Westmoreland, and in the
  New Forest. At the beginning of the last century, according to Gilbert
  White, there were 500 head of deer in Wolmer Forest, which were inspected
  by Queen Anne. The antlers may have as many as forty-eight points; and a
  stag with more than the three anterior tines is termed a "Royal Hart."
  The Fallow Deer has <!-- Page 294 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page294"></a>{294}</span>palmated antlers, and is usually spotted.
  It seems to be an introduced species, common report pointing to the
  Romans as the introducers. It would be more correct to say
  "re-introduced," for fossil remains of this Deer have been met with.</p>

  unbranched; the canines in the male are massive; it differs from
  <i>Cervulus</i>, to which it is closely allied, principally in the
  absence of frontal glands. The second <!-- Page 295 --><span

  iron-grey pelage, and the late Mr. Consul Swinhoe described it as very
  Goat-like in aspect.</p>

  <p><i>Capreolus.</i>&mdash;The Roe Deer has fairly complex antlers. It is
  a small Deer and has spotted young. The common Roe Deer, <i>C.
  capraea</i>, is a native of this country. It is the smallest of our Deer,
  and its antlers only have three tines in stags of the third year. It is a
  singular fact about this Deer that though the pairing season is in July
  and August, the young are not born until the following May or June, a
  period which does not represent that of gestation. The germ remains
  dormant for some time before developing.</p>

  simple spikes without branches. In this genus, and in the nearly allied

  <p><i>Alces machlis</i>, the Elk or Moose, is a circumpolar species with
  palmated antlers and is of large size. The young are unspotted. This
  animal is the largest of the Deer tribe. The aspect of this creature is
  by no means that of a Deer, the long, thick, and rather prehensile upper
  lip not by any means suggesting the family to which it belongs; the legs,
  too, are ungainly through their unusual length. The Moose has a curious
  method of protecting himself from Wolves. Instead of moving about during
  heavy snowstorms, and being thus on the heavy ground an easy prey for
  these agile enemies, the animal forms what is known as a "Moose yard." An
  area of ground is kept well <!-- Page 298 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page298"></a>{298}</span>trampled down, and the animal contents
  itself with browsing upon the adjacent stems. The well-trampled ground
  gives an easy footing, and by his powerful horns the great stag is able
  to keep his enemies at bay.</p>

  <p><i>Rangifer tarandus</i>, the Reindeer, is unique among Deer by reason
  of the fact that both sexes wear antlers. These antlers are palmated. The
  brow tine and the next or bez tine are also palmated and are directed
  forwards and a little downwards. The young are unspotted. The pelage
  alters in winter. Like the Moose, the Reindeer is circumpolar. As is well
  known, during the Pleistocene period the Reindeer extended its range as
  far as the South of France. Even in the historic period it is said to
  have been hunted in Caithness.</p>

  <p>Reindeer, like so many other particularly Arctic animals, have regular
  migrations. In Spitzbergen, for instance, the animal migrates in the
  summer to the inland region of the island, and in <!-- Page 299 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page299"></a>{299}</span>the autumn back again
  to the sea coast to browse upon the seaweed. These migrating herds have
  been stated to be led by a large female.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 2. Moschinae.</b>&mdash;<i>Moschus moschiferus</i><a
  name="NtA_195" href="#Nt_195"><sup>[195]</sup></a> is a native of the
  Asiatic Highlands. It is 3 feet or so high, perfectly hornless, and with
  very large canines in the male. It is noteworthy that in
  <i>Hydropotes</i>, where the canines are also very large, horns are
  absent. These are examples, perhaps, of correlation. The musk sac (whence
  the name) is present on the abdomen of the male only. There is no crumen
  or suborbital gland, which is so generally (though by no means
  universally) present in Cervidae. But the male has, in addition to the
  musk glands, glands near the tail and on the outside of the thigh. Unlike
  other Deer, the lachrymal bone of <i>Moschus</i> bears but one orifice.
  The feet, so far as concerns the preservation of the outer rudimentary
  <!-- Page 300 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page300"></a>{300}</span>metacarpals, are of the more ancient type
  represented in <i>Alces</i>, <i>Hydropotes</i>, etc. A gall-bladder is
  present. The young, as in so many Cervidae are spotted; but the adult is
  of a greyish-brown colour.</p>

      <a href="images/158.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/158.png"

  <p>There is no doubt that <i>Moschus</i> is more nearly related to the
  Cervidae than to any other Ruminants. It is regarded by Sir W. Flower as
  "an undeveloped deer&mdash;an animal which in most points (absence of
  horns, smooth brain, retention of gall-bladder, etc.) has ceased to
  progress with the rest of the group, while in some few (musk gland,
  mobile feet) it has taken a special line of advance of its own."</p>

  <p>The musk itself, which gives its name to the creature, is found in a
  gland on the belly, about the size of a hen's egg. The whole gland is cut
  out and sold in this condition. Such quantities of musk deer have been
  and are killed for this purpose that the rarity of the animal is
  increasing. In the seventeenth <!-- Page 301 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page301"></a>{301}</span>century it was so common that the
  traveller Tavernier purchased 7673 musk "pods" in one journey, or,
  according to Buffon, 1663. The tusks, which recall those of
  <i>Hydropotes</i>, to which <i>Moschus</i> is not nearly allied, and of
  <i>Tragulus</i>, with which it has of course still less connexion, are
  said to be used for the digging up of roots. Its feet, in relation to its
  mountain-ranging habits, are very mobile.</p>

  <p><b>Extinct Species of Deer.</b>&mdash;It has been already mentioned
  that the most primitive kinds of Deer had no horns at all, resembling in
  this the modern <i>Moschus</i> and <i>Hydropotes</i>, and that with lapse
  of time went hand in hand an increasing complexity of antler; the facts
  of palaeontology harmonising in the most striking manner with the facts
  of individual development from year to year. The oldest forms seem to be
  more nearly akin to the living Muntjacs, and their remains occur in the
  lowest Miocene beds of both Europe and America. At present the group is
  confined to the warmer parts of Asia and some of the islands belonging to
  that continent.</p>

  <p>One of the oldest types is <i>Amphitragulus</i>. This genus, which
  consists of several species, inhabited Europe, and differed from living
  Muntjacs in being totally hornless in both sexes; the skull had no
  lachrymal fossa or deficient lateral ossification.</p>

  <p>Nearly allied is <i>Dremotherium</i> of similar age and range.</p>

  <p>The Middle Miocene has furnished the remains of the genus
  <i>Dicroceras</i>. This is the earliest Deer in which horns have been
  found. The horns are, as the name of the genus implies, bifid, and have,
  like those of the living Muntjac, a very long pedicel. This is also a
  European genus like the last. From this period we come across true Deer,
  which commence in the Upper Miocene and have branched horns. Moreover
  they belong, at least for the most part, to the existing genera. One of
  the most remarkable forms is <i>Cervus sedgwicki</i> (sometimes placed in
  a separate genus, <i>Polycladus</i>) from the Forest Bed of Norfolk and
  from the Upper Pliocene of the Val d'Arno. This creature was remarkable
  for its multitudinously-branched antlers. These end in no less than
  twelve points. No Deer exists or has existed in which the horns are so
  completely branched. They are like those of a Red Deer exaggerated.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 7. Giraffidae.</b>&mdash;Undoubtedly the type of a distinct
  family, Giraffidae, is the genus <i>Giraffa</i>. It is characterised by
  <!-- Page 302 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page302"></a>{302}</span>the long neck, which, nevertheless,
  consists of only the normal seven vertebrae, and by the "horns" which
  differ from those of all other Ruminants; they are small bony prominences
  of the frontal bones, which become fused with the skull, and which are
  covered with unmodified skin. They are not shed. Between them is a median
  prominence. This cranial armature is present in the female as well as in
  the male, and is well developed even in the <!-- Page 303 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page303"></a>{303}</span>new-born young. The
  orbits are completely encircled by bone, and there is no lachrymal fossa,
  so common in Deer and Antelopes. There are no canines above; but these
  are present in the lower jaw. The rudimentary digits of other Ruminants
  have disappeared in this genus. There are fourteen pairs of ribs as in
  many other Artiodactyla. The liver of the Giraffe<a name="NtA_196"
  href="#Nt_196"><sup>[196]</sup></a> is, as in many, but not all,
  Ruminants, devoid of a gall-bladder; neither has it a caudate or a
  Spigelian lobe. The caecum is actually largish (2½ feet in length), but
  is relatively very small, as the small and the large intestines measure
  196 and 75 feet in length respectively. The Giraffe has a well-marked
  "ileo-caecal" gland, found in many Ruminants; its appearance in
  <i>Giraffa</i> is especially compared by Garrod with its appearance in
  <i>Alces</i>.</p>

  <p>Considered by itself, <i>Giraffa</i> forms a very isolated type of
  Ruminant. But after we have dealt with certain facts concerning extinct
  forms clearly allied to <i>Giraffa</i>, the isolation of the family will
  be found to be less marked.</p>

  <p>The Giraffe ("one who walks swiftly," the word means in Arabic) is, as
  every one knows, limited in its range to the African continent. It is
  not, however, so familiar a fact that there are two quite distinct
  species of Giraffe, one a northern form from Somaliland, and the other
  South African. The distinctness of these two, <i>G. camelopardalis</i>
  and <i>G. australis</i>, has been lately worked out in some detail by Mr.
  de Winton.<a name="NtA_197" href="#Nt_197"><sup>[197]</sup></a> The
  principal point of difference between them consists in the large size of
  the median horn in the Cape species, which is represented by the merest
  excrescence in the other species. The Giraffe of West Africa is held to
  differ from the northern and southern species, coming nearer to the
  former. It appears in the first place to be a larger animal, and slight
  differences in the skull have been pointed out. This series of
  peculiarities may be expressed, for those who do not object to trinomial
  nomenclature, by calling this novel western form <i>Giraffa
  camelopardalis peralta</i>. The existence of the three horns covered with
  unaltered skin is the main characteristic of this Ungulate. But the
  Giraffe also differs from other Artiodactyles by its enormously long
  neck, which enables it to browse upon trees inaccessible to the common
  herd <!-- Page 304 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page304"></a>{304}</span>of Ruminants. The neck is often supposed
  to have some relation to this method of feeding. But a more ingenious
  explanation of its inordinate length is that it serves as a watch-tower.
  The long grass of the districts inhabited by the animal swarms with Lions
  and Leopards, which must be foes. The long neck allows of a wide look out
  being kept, and it is noteworthy that the Ostrich, living under similar
  conditions, is also renowned for its length of neck. It is the spots upon
  the Giraffe which have given it its name of Cameleopard; these spots
  present in the southern form a series of chocolate-coloured areas,
  sharply marked off by white spaces. Of these spots it is asserted that
  they serve as a means of concealing their possessor. Sir Samuel Baker<a
  name="NtA_198" href="#Nt_198"><sup>[198]</sup></a> wrote of it in the
  following words: "The red-barked mimosa, which is its favourite food,
  seldom grows higher than 14 or 15 feet. Many woods are almost entirely
  composed of these trees, upon the flat heads of which the giraffe can
  feed when looking downwards. I have frequently been mistaken when
  remarking some particular dead tree-stem at a distance that appeared like
  a decayed relic of the forest, until upon nearer approach I have been
  struck by the peculiar inclination of the trunk; suddenly it has started
  into movement and disappeared."</p>

  <p>The Giraffe, remarked Pliny, "is as quiet as a sheep." The Roman
  public, to whom the first Giraffe ever brought into Europe was exhibited,
  expected from its name "to find in it a combination of the size of the
  camel and the ferocity of a panther." As a matter of fact, Giraffes in
  captivity are not always sheep-like in temper. They will kick with
  viciousness and vigour, and will even initiate an attack upon their
  keeper. At the same time they are singularly nervous creatures, and have
  been known to die from a shock. In moving, the Giraffe uses the fore- and
  hind-limb of each side simultaneously; this gives to its gait a peculiar
  rocking motion, the singularity of which is heightened by the curving
  movements of the long neck, which even describes now and then a figure of
  eight in the air. <i>Giraffa camelopardalis</i> and the species (?)
  already referred to are the only existing Giraffes (of the genus
  <i>Giraffa</i>), and they are not found out of Africa. Sir Harry Johnston
  has lately given a brief account of a larger and more brilliantly
  coloured species from Uganda <!-- Page 305 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page305"></a>{305}</span>which will probably prove to belong to a
  distinct genus. It has five horns, the additional pair being placed above
  the ears.</p>

  <p>Sir Harry Johnston has quite recently made known another genus of
  Giraffidae living in the Semliki forest, Belgian Congo district. The skin
  and two skulls, as well as the bones of the feet, are known from
  specimens sent by Sir Harry Johnston to the Natural History Museum, and
  briefly described to the Zoological Society by Professor Ray Lankester.<a
  name="NtA_199" href="#Nt_199"><sup>[199]</sup></a> This creature, of
  which the native name is "Okapi," is proposed to be called <i>Ocapia
  johnstoni</i>. The first actual specimens which reached this country were
  two bandoliers made from the skin of the flanks, which were striped black
  and white, and were not unnaturally held to be portions of the skin of a
  new species of Zebra. The animal is of about the size of a Sable
  Antelope, and the back and sides are of a rich brown colour; it is only
  the fore- and hind-limbs which are striped, the striping being
  longitudinal, <i>i.e.</i> parallel with the long axis of the body. The
  head is Giraffe-like, but there are no external horns; wisps of curled
  hairs seem to represent the vestiges of the horns of other Giraffes. The
  tail is rather short, and the neck is rather thick and short. The skull
  is clearly Giraffine. The basicranial axis is straight, and the
  fontanelle in the lachrymal region is very large. Upon the frontal bones
  near their parietal border is a large boss on either side, which
  presumably represents the horn core or "os cornu." On the mandible the
  great length of the diastema between the incisors and premolars is a
  Giraffine characteristic. The Okapi lives in pairs in the deepest
  recesses of the forest.</p>

  <p>We are acquainted with a few extinct forms, belonging to
  <i>Giraffa</i>, which are extra-African in range. <i>G. sivalensis</i> is
  from the Pliocene of the Siwalik Hills in India, <i>G. attica</i> from
  Greece. These remains, however, do not include the top of the skull, so
  that it is doubtful whether their horns were as in <i>G.
  camelopardalis</i>.</p>

  <p>A closely-allied genus is the extinct <i>Samotherium</i>. This
  flourished in Miocene times, and its remains have been found in the Greek
  island of Samos. The neck and limbs are shorter than in the Giraffe, and
  the horns, longer than in <i>Giraffa</i>, are placed just above the orbit
  upon the frontal bones alone, instead of upon the boundary line of
  frontals and parietals as in <i>Giraffa</i>. In several ways, therefore,
  the existing Giraffe is a more modified or <!-- Page 306 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page306"></a>{306}</span>specialised animal than
  its forerunner of the Miocene. In the latter, the male alone carried
  horns, and in neither sex does the unpaired median bony excrescence
  appear. The remains of this genus (probably even the same species, <i>S.
  boissieri</i>) also occur in Persia.</p>

  <p><i>Helladotherium</i> (there is but one species, <i>H. duvernoyi</i>)
  has its four limbs of nearly the same length; the skull of the only known
  example is hornless; the neck is shorter than in <i>Giraffa</i>. It is
  known from the Miocene deposits of Pikermi in Greece.</p>

  <p><i>Palaeotragus</i> is a genus which is not referred to the Giraffidae
  by all systematists. Its very name, given to it by the eminent French
  palaeontologist M. Gaudry, indicates his opinion as to its Antelopine
  affinities. The chief and indeed (according to Forsyth Major<a
  name="NtA_200" href="#Nt_200"><sup>[200]</sup></a>) the only reason for
  placing this Ruminant with the Antelopes is the large size of the horns.
  They undoubtedly suggest the horn cores of Antelopes. But they are placed
  wider apart than in those animals. It is thought that the hornless
  <i>Camelopardalis parva</i> is the female of this species, which is from
  Pikermi.</p>

  <p>Rather more different from <i>Giraffa</i> is the extinct genus
  <i>Sivatherium</i>, from the Siwalik deposits of India. Here again there
  has been some discussion as to its affinities. Some place it in the
  neighbourhood of <i>Antilocapra</i>, but most palaeontologists now regard
  it as a Giraffe. The main peculiarity of this large beast was the
  existence of two pairs of horn cores; the larger are upon the parietal
  bones, and are of a palmated form, with a few short tines, which are
  highly suggestive of those of the Elk (<i>Alces</i>). The shorter
  anterior pair are upon the frontal bones. The neck is short, the limbs of
  equal length, and there are no additional toes upon the limbs.
  <i>Sivatherium</i> was almost as large as an Elephant, and in
  restorations it is depicted as having a fleshy dilated nose like the
  Saiga Antelope; this view is based upon the position and size of the
  nasal bones. Hornless skulls have been identified as the female of
  <i>Sivatherium</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Vishnutherium</i>, <i>Hydraspotherium</i>, and <i>Bramatherium</i>
  are allied genera.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 8. Antilocapridae.</b>&mdash;This family contains but one
  genus and species, the N. American "Pronghorn," <i>Antilocapra
  americana</i>. This animal deserves a family to itself on account of the
  singular structure of the horns, which are intermediate in character <!--
  Page 307 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page307"></a>{307}</span>between those of the Deer and those of the
  Antelopes. They are unquestionably "hollow-horned" Ruminants, in that
  there is an osseous horn core, upon which lies the actual horn. This,
  however, is softer than in Bovidae, and is semicorneous. It is, indeed,
  more like the velvet of the stag's horn. Moreover the horn is branched,
  and there are sometimes even three prongs. Furthermore, it is now
  certainly known that the Pronghorn sheds its horns not merely
  occasionally, but with definite annual periodicity. It so far resembles
  the Deer. But it must be borne in mind that in the Deer the horn shedding
  is a twofold process. There is first of all the stripping off of the
  velvet, and secondly the shedding of a portion of the horn core down to
  the burr. What happens in the Prongbuck is the shedding of the true horn
  only ( = the shedding of the velvet), <i>not</i> of the horn core. It
  appears, however, that occasionally (once in their lifetime?) certain
  undoubted Antelopes may cast their horns.<a name="NtA_201"
  href="#Nt_201"><sup>[201]</sup></a> Another external character of this
  animal is the total absence of "false hoofs," the last vestiges of the
  second and fifth digits. The Pronghorn is a gregarious creature running
  in bands of six up to hundreds.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 9. Bovidae.</b>&mdash;This family, more extensive than that of
  the Cervidae, contains not only the Oxen, Sheep, and Goats, but also the
  Antelopes, save only <i>Antilocapra</i>, which must be placed in a family
  by itself. The only two points which distinguish all Bovidae from all
  Cervidae<a name="NtA_202" href="#Nt_202"><sup>[202]</sup></a> are the
  nature of the horns already described, and the polycotyledonary condition
  of the placenta. Moreover the horns are usually present in both sexes,
  though there are exceptions, such as the Sheep and Goats, and various
  genera of Antelopes (<i>Tragelaphus</i>, <i>Tetraceros</i>, etc.). There
  are never the first two phalanges belonging to the rudimentary digits
  II., V., as there are in all Deer excepting <i>Cervulus</i>. There is as
  a rule but one orifice to the lachrymal duct. There are never persistent
  upper canine teeth in either sex.</p>

  <p>It is exceedingly difficult to separate the Antelopes from the Sheep,
  Oxen, and Goats. Their inclusion along with these creatures in one
  family, Bovidae, shows that no differences of an important character
  exist. The term Antelope is rather of popular than <!-- Page 308 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page308"></a>{308}</span>of zoological
  significance. As a rule there are horns in both sexes; but this rule is
  not without exceptions, of which one is the genus <i>Strepsiceros</i>,
  the Koodoo. Many other Bovidae are horned in the males only, e.g.
  <i>Saiga</i>, <i>Tragelaphus</i>. The Antelopes further differ from the
  true Oxen in their more graceful build, and in the fact that the horns,
  if they curve at all, generally curve backwards towards the neck. In the
  Oxen, on the other hand, the build is stouter, and the horns usually
  curve outwards. The same remarks apply to the Sheep. Such an Antelope,
  however, as the Eland (<i>Orias</i>) is very Ox-like in habit. Another
  feature which may be remarked upon, though not of absolute differential
  value, is that while the Antelopes are as a rule smooth and sleek in
  their skins, the Oxen tend to be rough and shaggy. The Zebu, however, in
  this, in its hump, and in general aspect, is far from being unlike an
  Eland. But then the Zebu is a domestic race, and we do not know what the
  wild stock was like. It is perhaps with the Goats that the Antelopes have
  the nearest affinities, and it is difficult to place such a form as
  <i>Nemorrhaedus</i>, and indeed some others. In the Antelopes as a rule
  the middle lower incisors are larger than the lateral ones; in the Sheep
  and Goats they are alike in size. The parietal bones, too, in the
  Antelopes are moderately large and are much shortened in the remaining
  Cavicornia, especially in the Oxen. As the Antelopes are the oldest, so
  far as we know, of all bovine animals, one would expect to find them
  combining the characters of the rest. But they do this so effectually
  that a disentanglement is really impossible. They date from the Miocene.
  Antelopes are now limited to Europe, Asia, and Africa; they have always
  had the same range, though more abundant in former times in Europe. They
  preponderate now in tropical Africa, and abound in genera and species.
  Messrs. Sclater and Thomas<a name="NtA_203"
  href="#Nt_203"><sup>[203]</sup></a> allow altogether thirty-five genera,
  of which twenty-four are exclusively Ethiopian in range.</p>

  <p>In the following summary of the group Messrs. Sclater and Thomas's
  work is followed. They commence with a section or sub-family of which the
  type is the Hartebeest.</p>

  <p><i>Bubalis</i>, or <i>Alcelaphus</i> as it is sometimes called, is an
  African genus, ranging however into Arabia. These Antelopes are
  characterised by the long skull and the doubly-curved horns. There are
  eight species of the genus, of which <i>B. caama</i> is the <!-- Page 309
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page309"></a>{309}</span>best known;
  this is the animal known as the Hartebeest. The Bontebok and Blessbok
  belong to a closely-allied genus, <i>Damaliscus</i>, distinguished mainly
  by the fact that the bony base of the horn cores is not extended upwards,
  and therefore the parietal bones are visible when the skull is viewed
  from in front, which is not the case in <i>Bubalis</i>.</p>

  from South Africa. They are <i>C. gnu</i>, <i>C. taurinus</i>, and <i>C.
  albogulatus</i>.</p>

  <p>Of the Cephalophine section there are two genera<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p><i>Cephalophus</i> is an African genus. These animals are known as
  Duikerboks; they are small, and have short non-curved horns in the male
  sex only. Their general aspect is not unlike that of certain Deer with
  simple horns, such as <i>Cervulus</i>. Messrs. Sclater and Thomas allow
  thirty-eight species. The <!-- Page 310 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page310"></a>{310}</span>smallest species do not exceed the
  dimensions of a Hare. None are really large.</p>

  <p><i>Tetraceros</i> is an Indian genus characterised, as its name
  denotes, by the fact that it possesses four horns. It is the posterior
  pair which correspond to the single pair of <i>Cephalophus</i>. The
  anterior pair, which are much smaller and are sometimes absent, are a new
  pair. The female of this Antelope is hornless. Sheep are occasionally
  four-horned, and there is indeed a breed of such in Kashmir. A
  four-horned Chamois was described by the late Mr. Alston.</p>

  <p>The Klipspringer, <i>Oreotragus saltator</i>, is the first type of a
  third section; as its name denotes, it is an Antelope with Goat-like
  habits, being found particularly among rocks. The horns are short and
  straight. This, the only species of the genus, is African in range, of
  which its Dutch name gives evidence. A specimen in the Zoological
  Society's Gardens (as has been pointed out to me by Mr. Mercer) had the
  habit of depositing the secretion of the tear gland upon a mass of
  concrete in its enclosure, the secretion thus exuded forming a pointed
  heap of hardish matter. It may be that the object of this is to guide its
  fellows to its whereabouts.</p>

  <p><i>Ourebia</i> is a less-known genus, larger in size, but with horns
  of the same character, though longer.</p>

  <p>The Grysbok and the Steinbok, genus <i>Raphiceros</i>, have similar
  horns. This as well as the last two genera have horns in the male
  only.</p>

  <p>One of the smallest of Antelopes belongs to an allied genus; this is
  <i>Neotragus pygmaeus</i>. It is known as the Royal Antelope, a name
  apparently derived from Bosman's statement that the negroes called it
  "the king of the harts." Its horns are very small. The height of the
  animal is only 10 inches. Horns are present in the male alone. The last
  three genera are African.</p>

  <p>The Cervicaprine series, which is also African, includes the
  Waterbucks and Reedbucks, so called on account of their water-loving
  propensities. As in the last series, from which they are separated by
  Sclater and Thomas, but with which they are united by Flower, there are
  horns in the male only. These horns, though not twisted, are long. The
  typical genus is <i>Cobus</i>, of which there are eleven species. The
  Waterbuck, <i>C. ellipsiprymnus</i>, and the Sing-sing, <i>C.
  unctuosus</i>, are perhaps the best-known species; the former is <!--
  Page 311 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page311"></a>{311}</span>blackish grey, the latter browner in
  colour. In <i>C. maria</i> and one or two other species the horns are
  more curved backwards and again forwards than in some of the others,
  where their form is sublyrate.</p>

  <p>The Reedbucks, <i>Cervicapra</i>, are closely allied to <i>Cobus</i>;
  they are, however, of smaller size. Here, as in that genus, the females
  are hornless, and the horns of the males are of medium size. Five species
  are referred to the genus. They are all of a brownish fawn colour. A
  genus <i>Pelea</i>, with but one species, <i>P. capreolus</i>, has been
  separated on account of the fact that the horns are nearly straight and
  that there is no naked patch of skin beneath the ears. This animal has
  received its name on account of its resemblance to the Roebuck.</p>

  <p>The Antilopine section includes a number of genera.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Antilope</i> is Indian in range. It includes but one
  species, <i>A. cervicapra</i>. This Antelope is of medium size, with a
  brown pelage getting blacker with years; it is thus known as the
  Black-buck. The female, which is hornless, is lighter brown. The horns
  are long, spirally twisted, and closely ringed.</p>

  <p><i>Aepyceros</i>, with two species, is African. The Palla (<i>Ae.
  melampus</i>) is a large Antelope, with longish lyrate horns in the male,
  which are half-ringed.</p>

  <p>The Saiga Antelope, genus <i>Saiga</i>, is one of the most remarkable
  types of Antelope in its outward appearance. Its nose is very large and
  inflated, the two nostrils being quite widely separated, a depression
  indeed lying between them dorsally. The horns are lyrate in the male,
  absent in the female. The "ovine expression" of this bovine animal is
  more pronounced in the female. Corresponding with the clumsy nose are
  very short nostrils, the commencement of the narial aperture being
  therefore very far back. It is almost suggestive of <i>Macrauchenia</i>
  in this respect. The fleece is also Sheep-like. The genus occurred in
  this country during the Pleistocene. It is now an inhabitant of Eastern
  Europe and Western Asia. The only species is <i>S. tartarica</i>.</p>

  <p>The Chiru, <i>Pantholops</i>, is allied to the Saiga. The horns of the
  male are long and nearly straight; they are ringed in front. The muzzle
  is swollen in the male; the nostrils are large, and provided with
  extensive sacs internally. The colour of this animal, which is
  exclusively Thibetan in range, is a pale fawn. The hair, in accord with
  its habitat, is very woolly. No living specimens have ever been brought
  to Europe. This creature has accumulated much <!-- Page 312 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page312"></a>{312}</span>legend. Its blood is
  believed by the Mongols to possess virtues, and by means of the rings on
  the horns fortunes are told. Naturally the animal is on these grounds
  hard to stalk and shoot.</p>

  <p>The Gazelles, genus <i>Gazella</i>, are fairly numerous in species,
  which are both Palaearctic and Ethiopian. There are altogether
  twenty-five of them. The genus as a whole is characterised by the small
  or moderate size, the sandy coloration with white belly, the presence of
  dark and light stripes on the face and on the flanks. These streaks,
  however, are not always present, and their presence or absence serves to
  differentiate some of the species. The horns are usually present in both
  sexes. The horns are of fair length, ringed, and of lyrate form.</p>

  <p>The Springbok is separated from the rest of the Gazelles, to which
  genus it is clearly most nearly related, as a genus <i>Antidorcas</i>.
  This genus differs from <i>Gazella</i> by having only two lower premolars
  as in <i>Saiga</i>. Otherwise it resembles the Gazelles; there is but a
  single species, <i>A. euchore</i>, which is African. <!-- Page 313
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page313"></a>{313}</span></p>

  <p><i>Ammodorcas</i> is closely allied to the Gazelles, but differs from
  them in having an elongated neck and also a long tail. <i>A. clarkei</i>,
  the only species, is limited to Somaliland.</p>

  <p><i>Lithocranius</i>, not unlike the last, has a still longer neck,
  which makes it almost Giraffe-like; its tail, however, is short. The
  scientific name is derived from the "solid stony character of the
  cranium." In running, this Gazelle carries the head forward in a straight
  line with the body. It is African.</p>

  <p><i>Dorcotragus</i> with one species, <i>D. megalotis</i>, is a pigmy
  Gazelle restricted to Somaliland. Its likeness, on account of size and in
  some other superficial features, to the Klipspringer, led to its original
  confusion with that genus (<i>Oreotragus</i>).</p>

  <p>A sub-family Hippotraginae, or Hippotragine section, includes a number
  of Antelopes which agree in the possession of four mammae, and of molars
  more like those of the true Oxen, of <!-- Page 314 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page314"></a>{314}</span>horns of some length,
  present in both sexes, and of a longish tail. They are all African in
  range.</p>

  <p>The type genus <i>Hippotragus</i> has its horns placed above the
  orbits; they are not twisted, but curved backwards. There are three
  species in the genus. Of these the best known is <i>H. niger</i>, the
  beautiful Sable Antelope. Its general colour is a rich, dark, glossy
  brown with white stripes on the face, and with a white belly. The other
  species are the Roan Antelope, <i>H. equinus</i>, and the Blaaubok, <i>H.
  leucophaeus</i>, of which the last specimen was probably killed in
  1799.<a name="NtA_205" href="#Nt_205"><sup>[205]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The genus <i>Oryx</i> (chiefly African, but also Arabian and Syrian)
  also contains a number of species, which are fairly familiar through the
  fact that several of them are always on view in the Zoological Society's
  Gardens. The genus differs from <i>Hippotragus</i> in that the horns,
  present in both sexes, are placed behind the orbits, and slant backwards
  in a line with the face. They are annulated. The Leucoryx (<i>O.
  leucoryx</i>) is of a pale colour, but <!-- Page 315 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page315"></a>{315}</span>this is not so marked
  as in <i>O. beatrix</i>, which is largely white with, however, brown
  legs. The Gemsbok is a handsome creature with greyish tawny colour, much
  darker on the legs, and with a Gazelle-like, dark, side stripe. It has
  received its vernacular name on account of its supposed likeness to the
  Chamois ("Gemse"), just as the Rehbok was so-called from its supposed
  likeness to the Roe Deer, and the Eland to the Elk. The Beisa (<i>O.
  beisa</i>) is of a similar tawny colour to the last, and also with darker
  stripes.</p>

  <p>The Addax (<i>Addax</i>) of North Africa, Arabia and Syria, has but
  one species (<i>A. nasomaculatus</i>). The horns are spirally
  twisted.</p>

  <p>The Tragelaphine section includes the Kudus, Elands, Nilgais, and
  Harnessed Antelopes. They are all long-horned (when the horns are present
  in both sexes), the horns being twisted; the nose is naked with a slight
  median groove, and all are Ethiopian or Oriental in range.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Tragelaphus</i> includes the Harnessed Antelopes, so
  called on account of the direction of the stripes suggesting harness. The
  females are hornless, and the colours of the two sexes are different. The
  hoofs are long and the toes rather unusually separable, which state of
  affairs is in accord with the <!-- Page 316 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  gratus</i> and <i>T. spekei</i> are larger forms; the Boschbok, <i>T.

  <p>The Kudus, genus <i>Strepsiceros</i>, have more markedly twisted
  horns, which are absent in the female. The body is vertically striped
  with white. The largest species is <i>S. kudu</i>; a smaller form, <i>S.

  <p>The last genus of this section or sub-family is the African Eland,
  genus <i>Oreas</i><a name="NtA_206" href="#Nt_206"><sup>[206]</sup></a>
  (which it appears should be spelt <i>Orias</i>). The Elands are perhaps
  more Ox-like in appearance than the other members of this group, and in
  both sexes have horns, in which the spiral twisting is more close.
  <i>Orias canna</i> is the name of the common Eland. <i>O.
  livingstonii</i> has been applied to an East African variety, which has
  thin and faint lateral stripes like the other members of the group to
  which it belongs.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Boselaphus</i> includes only <i>B. tragocamelus</i>, the
  Nilgai, which is purely Indian in range. The female is hornless, and the
  horns of the male are smooth and not long. <!-- Page 317 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page317"></a>{317}</span></p>

  <p>The members of the Bovine section or Oxen are to be distinguished from
  other hollow-horned Ruminants by their stouter build and by the fact that
  the horns stand out from the sides of the skull and are simply curved,
  not twisted; and smooth, not annulate like those of other Ruminants. The
  muffle is naked, broad, and moist. The Oxen are widely distributed; but
  are entirely absent from the Australian region and from South America and
  Madagascar.</p>

  <p>The true Oxen are perhaps best considered to form but a single genus,
  <i>Bos</i>. They have, however, been divided into a number of genera.
  Even the supposed aberrant <i>Anoa depressicornis</i> of Celebes hardly
  differs sufficiently to warrant its separation. In favour of this view,
  too, is the extraordinary ease with which different "genera" will cross
  with each other and produce fertile offspring. The following is the
  pedigree of an animal lately living in the Zoological Society's Gardens.
  The female offspring of a male Zebu and a female Gayal was mated with a
  male Bison. The female calf was again mated with a Bison and produced a
  calf, also a female, which contained therefore the three species, <i>Bos
  indicus</i>, <i>Bibos frontalis</i>, and <i>Bison americanus</i>. It is
  clearly unwise in view of this fact to insist too much upon generic
  distinctions in any of those types.<a name="NtA_207"
  href="#Nt_207"><sup>[207]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Of this genus the Oriental Gaur (<i>Bos gaurus</i>), the Gayal (<i>B.
  frontalis</i>), and the Banteng (<i>B. sondaicus</i>) form a well-marked
  section, characterised by their dark coloration and by the somewhat
  flattened horns.</p>

  <p>The Gaur, <i>Bos gaurus</i>, has a more concave forehead than its
  allies; the horns are less curved than those of the Banteng, and less so
  than the horns of the Gayal (<i>Bos frontalis</i>). It inhabits the
  Indian Peninsula; and extends through Burmah to the extremity of the
  Malay Peninsula. The Malay name of this animal is Sakiutan, which simply
  means wild cattle. It chiefly frequents wooded hills and is an excellent
  mountain climber.</p>

  <p><i>Bos frontalis</i>, the Indian Gayal, has a white caudal disc like
  the last species, but the forehead is flat and the horns curve but
  little. It is chiefly known as a tame animal, and its occurrence in the
  wild state has been doubted. It has furthermore been suggested that it is
  merely a tame race of the Gaur altered <!-- Page 318 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page318"></a>{318}</span>slightly through
  domestication. It is, however, said not to cross in a state of nature
  with the Gaur.<a name="NtA_208" href="#Nt_208"><sup>[208]</sup></a></p>

<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 166.&mdash;Gayal. <i>Bos frontalis.</i> × <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">20</span>.</p>

  <p>The Banteng, <i>B. sondaicus</i>, is distributed through Chittagong,
  Tenasserim, and the Malay Peninsula to Java and Borneo. There are
  apparently two races of this animal. The species differs from the others
  by the fact that the horns are smaller and more curved; there is a white
  caudal disc; the forehead is narrower and the skull longer than in the
  others.</p>

  <p>The American Bison and the European Aurochs form another section; they
  are indeed extremely alike, specific differences being hardly
  recognisable. The Bison of America, formerly present in such numbers that
  the prairies were black with countless herds, has now diminished to about
  a thousand head.</p>

  <p>One of the largest of existing Bovidae is the Aurochs, Wisent, or
  European Bison, <i>Bos bonasus</i> (or <i>Bison europaeus</i>). It is
  exceedingly like its American relative. Formerly the animal was much more
  widely spread than it is now, extending its range from Europe into North
  America. It is now limited to certain districts on the Urals, in the
  Caucasus, and a herd of them are kept up through the fostering care of
  the Emperor of Russia in the forest of Bielovege in Lithuania. The term
  "Aurochs" should not really be applied to this species but to the Wild
  Cattle, <i>Bos taurus</i>. It is, however, so generally used for the
  Wisent (which is the German name) that it <!-- Page 319 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page319"></a>{319}</span>is not necessary to
  change it. The Sclavonic name is Zubr or Suber. It is a great beast,
  standing 6 feet or so in height at the shoulder. It ranged further over
  Europe well within the historic period. In the days of Charlemagne it was
  spread over Germany and was a beast of the chase. In the year 1848 the
  Emperor of Russia presented a pair of these Oxen to the Zoological
  Society of London. At the time of their presentation an interesting
  communication was made to the Society by M. Dolmatoff, on the method of
  the capture of these two examples. The creature is not easy to capture
  and is alarming to confront. "The eyes," says an old writer, "are red and
  fiery; the looks are furious and commanding." It has of course the shaggy
  mane and hump of the American animal. The herd in Lithuania was said to
  be 1900 in the year 1856. Mr. E. N. Buxton,<a name="NtA_209"
  href="#Nt_209"><sup>[209]</sup></a> who has lately visited the forest,
  quotes M. Neverli to the effect that at present the numbers are not more
  than 700.</p>

  <p>Allied to this animal, and apparently still nearer to the American
  Bison, is the extinct <i>B. priscus</i> of Europe. The Pleistocene Bisons
  of North America, <i>B. antiquus</i> and <i>B. latifrons</i>, are not
  remote from the living forms. Finally, the Miocene <i>B. sivalensis</i>
  from India, and the Pliocene <i>B. ferox</i> and <i>B. alleni</i> of
  North America, take back this group to as remote a period as any other
  genus of Oxen. <!-- Page 320 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  however, to be a hybrid between <!-- Page 321 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  least two Buffaloes. We may finally mention the Wild Ox of Europe, <i>B.
  primigenius</i>, the supposed progenitor of our domestic cattle, believed
  to be still surviving in the herds at Chillingham, Chartley, and
  elsewhere. This animal is sometimes called the Aurochs. The Romans spoke
  of it as the Urus, and it appears to have formerly attained to more
  gigantic proportions than at present. It is the small size of the present
  race that is the chief objection to tracing them back to the large Oxen
  existing near London in 1174, and found sub-fossil in the Cambridgeshire
  fens.</p>

  <p>Of the true sheep, genus <i>Ovis</i>, there are a considerable number
  of species. The Sheep are to be distinguished from the Goats by their
  rather stouter build and by the absence of the beard in the male. The
  horns are developed in both sexes, and are usually twisted and often of
  large size.</p>

  <p>The Sheep are almost entirely Palaearctic and Nearctic. They only just
  get into the Oriental region. One of the finest species is the great
  Pamir Sheep, <i>O. poli</i>, whose length reaches 6 feet <!-- Page 322
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page322"></a>{322}</span>7 inches, and
  height 3 feet 10 inches. The horns of this fine Sheep may measure more
  than five feet round the curves. The Rocky Mountain Bighorn (<i>O.
  montana</i>) is a Sheep ranging along the Rockies as far south as New
  Mexico, and also to the far north; they are not confined to the chain of
  mountains mentioned, but occur also on the mountains of British Columbia
  down to those of California. The horns are not quite as large as those of
  the last species, but measurements give a length (along the curve) of 32
  to 40 inches.<a name="page323"></a></p>

  <p>Just as the Goats are often limited to islands and small stretches of
  country, so are the Sheep. Thus Cyprus has a species, <i>O. ophion</i>,
  peculiar to itself. This, which is known as the Cyprus Mouflon, is
  limited to a range of mountains, the Troodos, in that island. In 1878 it
  was believed that the animal was nearly exterminated, a flock of
  twenty-five members alone surviving. They have, however, since increased.
  Confined <!-- Page 324 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p><i>Ovis nahura</i> is chiefly responsible for the impossibility of
  strictly separating the Sheep and Goats. It has no suborbital glands or
  lachrymal fossae, which are as a rule present in the Sheep and absent
  from the Goats. On the other hand interdigital glands are present, which
  is the case with Sheep. Its habits, too, are a blending of those of the
  Sheep and the Goat. It lives largely on undulating ground like Sheep, and
  frequently lies down during the day on its feeding ground. On the other
  hand it is, like the Goats, a splendid climber.</p>

  <p>The Goats, genus <i>Capra</i>, differ from the Sheep in their slighter
  build and in the fact that the horns are not spirally curved, but arched
  over the back. There is also the characteristic beard, <!-- Page 325
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page325"></a>{325}</span>and the male
  is odorous. The true Goats are almost exclusively Palaearctic in range.
  They show the limited distribution of the Sheep, a distribution which
  follows from their mountain-loving habits.</p>

  <p>Thus we have the Spanish Ibex (<i>C. pyrenaica</i>), limited to the
  Pyrenees and other mountain ranges of the peninsula; <i>C. ibex</i>, the
  Steinbok of the Alps and the Tyrol; the Markhoor, <i>C. falconeri</i>, of
  certain mountain ranges of Afghanistan; the Caucasian, Sinaitic, and
  Cretan Ibexes, and the Thar.</p>

  <p><i>Capra aegagrus</i>, the Persian Wild Goat, ranges from the Caucasus
  to Sind. It is this animal which produces the true "bezoar stone." The
  substance in question is a secretion apparently found in the stomach. It
  is still, according to Mr. Blanford, regarded as an antidote to poison in
  Persia. Buffon called this Goat the "Pasan," which is evidently a
  corruption of the word bezoar. When the substance was in repute as a
  medicine of the "alexipharmic" kind, the supply naturally came up to the
  demand. Thus the bezoar stones of the Lama in South America gained
  repute, and there were "Oriental bezoar, cow <!-- Page 326 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page326"></a>{326}</span>bezoar, hog bezoar, and
  monkey bezoar"! As concretions of one kind or another are not uncommon
  objects in the alimentary tract of mammals it was easy enough to obtain a
  fair amount of some substance which was sure to sell well. It is said
  that a stone weighing four ounces was once sold in this country (or at
  any rate in Europe) for £200.</p>

  <p>"There can be no doubt," observes Mr. Blanford, "that <i>C.
  aegagrus</i> is one of the species, and probably the principal, from
  which tame goats are derived."</p>

  <p>The Musk Ox, <i>Ovibos moschatus</i>, has been thought to be on the

  scientific name. It is a purely Arctic creature, now confined to the
  Nearctic region; but it formerly existed in the Arctic regions of
  Europe.</p>

  <p>The anatomy of the "soft parts" of this genus has lately been
  investigated by Dr. Lönnberg.<a name="NtA_210"
  href="#Nt_210"><sup>[210]</sup></a> The animal has no foot glands such as
  occur in <i>Ovis</i>. Its kidneys, however, are non-lobate, and it has
  orbital glands. The cotyledons of the placenta are unusually large, and
  the cow has the "primary four" teats. It cannot, in fact, be definitely
  referred to either the Caprine or the Bovine section of the Cavicornia,
  and while possibly most allied to <i>Budorcas</i>, it may be regarded, at
  least for the present, as entitled to form a separate sub-family of its
  own. The muzzle <!-- Page 328 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page328"></a>{328}</span>has a slight naked strip above the
  nostrils, as in the Sheep, but there is no fissure of the upper lip.</p>

<h5><b>Extinct Families of Artiodactyla.</b></h5>

  <p>The origin of the Artiodactyla is placed by Cope in the family
  <b>Pantolestidae</b>,<a name="NtA_211"
  href="#Nt_211"><sup>[211]</sup></a> allied to the genus
  <i>Protogonodon</i> of the Condylarthra. As, however, this family is
  represented by but a few back teeth and a fragment of the hind-foot, it
  seems premature to regard it as the necessary starting-point of the
  Bunodont and Ruminant groups.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. Anthracotheriidae.</b>&mdash;This well-known and ancient
  family consists of creatures of for the most part a Pig-like form, with
  teeth approaching the selenodont shape, and a complete dentition. The
  carpals, tarsals, metacarpals, and metatarsals are all free. The toes are
  four (or five) to each foot, with the outermost beginning to be reduced.
  These of course are all generalised and primitive characters, pointing
  nowhere in particular, except, of course, to an Artiodactyle stock, on
  account of the teeth and the two predominating toes.</p>

  <p>The type genus of the family, <i>Anthracotherium</i>, is not, as its
  name might seem to denote, a relic of the Carboniferous period; its
  remains were found in lignite, which may also show that it was at least
  semi-aquatic in habit. Its form, however, must have been Pig-like, so at
  least one would presume from the elongated skull and shortish legs. There
  were species as great as a Rhinoceros, and smaller forms. The genus began
  in the Oligocene and continued down to the Pliocene. It is known from
  Europe, Asia, and America.</p>

  <p>The skull is long with a prominent sagittal crest. The facial part is
  also very long, and the orbits are not closed by a bony ring. The
  premolars are simple teeth; the molars distinctly bunodont with a
  tendency in one or two to the selenodont condition. The canines are
  powerful, as are also the incisors. The scapula has been specially
  compared with that of the Camel. It has no acromion, which is usually
  though not always absent in Ungulates. An ally of the present animal, for
  instance, the Hippopotamus, has the acromion developed. The radius and
  ulna, the tibia and fibula, are all fully developed. <!-- Page 329
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page329"></a>{329}</span></p>

  <p><i>Ancodus</i> (or <i>Hyopotamus</i>, as it has been called) is also
  Oligocene in range, and its remains have been found in the same countries
  as have those of <i>Anthracotherium</i>. Both genera are indeed closely
  allied. <i>Ancodus</i> seems to be a more slightly-built creature. The
  skull looks weaker, but presents much the same features of organisation.
  In <i>A. velaunus</i>, a species found in French rocks, a metacarpal of
  digit I. was present in the manus, while <i>A. brachyrhynchus</i> had a
  completely five-fingered manus.</p>

  <p>The Miocene genus <i>Merycopotamus</i> (from the lower layers of the
  Siwalik formation in India) is more distinctly selenodont than the forms
  already discussed. On this ground it has been placed in a separate
  sub-family. As, however, in other respects it does not depart from the
  Anthracotherian type of structure, this proceeding seems to be hardly
  necessary. There are two species known, of which one, <i>M. nanus</i>,
  is, as its name denotes, a dwarf form.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. Caenotheriidae.</b>&mdash;While the last family consisted of
  animals rather more akin to the Pigs, the present is more Pecorine in its
  characters. The molars are selenodont; but as in the Tragulidae the
  premolars are more of the nature of cutting teeth. The dentition, like
  that of so many of these early Ungulates, is complete, and the canines
  are not prominent. The feet are four-toed, the lateral toes not reaching
  the ground.</p>

  <p>The principal genus is the Eocene and Miocene <i>Caenotherium</i>. Of
  this genus there were a considerable number of species all European in
  range, and of small size&mdash;not more than a foot or so in length.
  Their small size is suggestive of the Chevrotains. In the skull the
  orbital cavity is nearly or quite surrounded by bone, and the tympanic
  bulla is large and inflated. A common feature of Artiodactyles, a failure
  of the nasals and maxillae to meet at the side of the face, is to be seen
  in this ancient forerunner of the Pecora.</p>

  <p><i>Plesiomeryx</i>, also European, and from the same geological
  horizon, is a very closely allied form.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. Xiphodontidae.</b>&mdash;This family consists of slender,
  small Artiodactyles which are, like the Caenotheriidae, related to the
  Pecora. They are confined in their range to Europe.</p>

  <p>The type genus <i>Xiphodon</i> has selenodont molars and elongated,
  slender, cutting premolars. The dentition was complete and the canines
  not highly developed. Like <i>Caenotherium</i>, <!-- Page 330 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page330"></a>{330}</span><i>Xiphodon</i> was a
  hornless creature, but with only two toes, the two lateral digits being
  represented by the merest rudiments of metacarpals. The other metacarpals
  were unusually long.</p>

  <p><i>Amphimeryx</i> (also called <i>Xiphodontotherium</i>) is much more
  imperfectly known, but belongs to this family or to that of the
  Caenotheriidae. <i>Dichodon</i> is another member of the same family.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. Oreodontidae.</b>&mdash;This family, consisting of numerous
  genera, is limited to the North American continent. Its range in time is
  from the Eocene to the Lower Pliocene. The family as a whole is to be
  distinguished by a number of primitive characters. The dentition is
  complete; the feet are four- or even five-toed; the orbit is sometimes
  open behind. The canines of the lower jaw are not more pronounced than
  the incisors. The characteristics of the group will be further developed
  by a consideration of some of the principal genera which are included in
  this family.</p>

  <p><i>Oreodon</i> is a Miocene form about as large as a Peccary. The
  skull has a short face with a completely-closed orbital cavity. In front
  of the orbit is a deep pit, not a mere deficiency of ossification, such
  as occurs in many Artiodactyles. This is placed on the lachrymal bone,
  and is in fact a lachrymal fossa, such as occurs in other forms. The
  odontoid process of the axis vertebra is somewhat cheese-taster shaped,
  as in recent Artiodactyles. There are fourteen dorsal vertebrae and a
  very large number of caudals. The radius and the ulna are completely
  separated, as are the carpals. There are five digits to the fore-limbs.
  The fibula is complete and independent. The hind-foot is four-toed.
  Several species of the genus are known.</p>

  <p><i>Merycochoerus</i> is an allied Miocene genus. It is more massive in
  form than the last, but otherwise does not present differences of
  importance.</p>

  <p><i>Mesoreodon</i> is another genus of this family which presents some
  curious features of organisation. In the skull and teeth there is nothing
  very noteworthy, but the hyoid is remarkable. This appendage of the skull
  is by no means always preserved, and when it is, it might be denied that
  it belonged to any particular skull. In the present case there appears to
  be no doubt as to the identity of the bones, which resemble the
  corresponding bones of the Perissodactyla much more than they do those of
  other Artiodactyles. Associated with the bones an ossified <!-- Page 331
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page331"></a>{331}</span>thyroid
  cartilage of the larynx was found. As the skull was that of a male, this
  character may be a sexual one. It is quite comparable to the ossification
  of the same cartilage in the American monkey <i>Callithrix</i>. "The
  function of the bone," observes Professor Scott,<a name="NtA_212"
  href="#Nt_212"><sup>[212]</sup></a> "was probably similar to that
  performed by the enormously-inflated basihyal of the howling monkeys, and
  must have given to these animals most unusual powers of voice." Another
  important anatomical fact about <i>Mesoreodon</i> is the apparent
  existence of a clavicle. It is of course conceivable that the remains of
  some other animal have got mixed up with that of the individuals upon
  which the present genus is founded; but failing that, here is a clavicle
  in an Ungulate. The spine of the scapula possesses a metacromion. This
  greater development of the spine of the scapula in Artiodactyles than in
  Perissodactyles is, it is suggested, to be correlated with the earlier
  loss of the clavicle in the latter group of Ungulates.</p>

  <p><i>Cyclopidius</i> (synonymous with <i>Brachymeryx</i>) is a kind of
  pug form of <i>Oreodon</i>. The skull is short and broad, and the end of
  the snout a little turned up. The upper incisors are small and drop out
  early. On each side of the nasals is a large oval vacuity which is
  perhaps to be compared to the lateral deficiency to be found in other
  Artiodactyles. One species of this singular-looking form is appropriately
  called <i>C. simus</i>.</p>

  <p>Other allied genera are <i>Merychyus</i> and <i>Leptauchenia</i>. The
  former extends as far down as the Lower Pliocene, and is thus one of the
  newest forms of Oreodontidae.</p>

  <p><i>Agriochoerus</i><a name="NtA_213"
  href="#Nt_213"><sup>[213]</sup></a> (Fig. 178) is placed in a separate
  sub-family from the types which have just been considered. It is Miocene
  in range. It differs from <i>Oreodon</i> and its closer relatives by the
  fact that the orbit is open behind and not closed. The most remarkable
  fact about this creature is that the terminal phalanges of the digits
  (five in the fore- and four in the hind-feet) being pointed, seem to
  suggest their encasement with claws rather than hoofs. The pollex, though
  small, seems to have been opposable. As with other Oreodonts, the molars
  are selenodont. The premaxillae are toothless&mdash;at least in adults,
  for two teeth are present in the <!-- Page 332 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page332"></a>{332}</span>young. There are
  several species. <i>Agriochoerus</i>, like <i>Oreodon</i> and primitive
  Ungulates in general, had a long tail. The genus thus shows a mixture of
  ancient and specialised characters.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:68%;">
      <a href="images/178.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/178.png"

  </div>
<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 178.&mdash;Skeleton of <i>Agriochoerus latifrons</i>. × &#x215B;. (After Wortman.)</p>

  <p>The most ancient form of Oreodont is <i>Protoreodon</i>. This is
  Eocene, and became extinct during that period. It had a complete
  dentition, open orbit, and no lachrymal fossa. The fore-feet were
  five-toed, the hind four-toed.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. Anoplotheriidae.</b>&mdash;This family is entirely Eocene in
  point of time, and is unknown outside Europe. The dentition of the group
  is complete; the molars are seleno-bunodont, like those of the
  Anthracotheriidae. The bones of the carpus, tarsus, metacarpus and
  metatarsus are all free; the toes are four to two in number on each foot.
  The orbit is widely open behind. The tail is long, as in <i>Xiphodon</i>,
  etc. <!-- Page 333 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page333"></a>{333}</span></p>

  <p>These general characters only just serve to differentiate the family;
  but they illustrate its archaic character, in which it resembles the
  Xiphodontidae, and even more the Anthracotheriidae. A survey of some of
  the genera which have been assigned to the family will bring out other
  features in the organisation of these very ancient Artiodactyles.</p>

  <p><i>Anoplotherium</i> is so called on account of the fact that it is,
  like all ancient Artiodactyles, without horns or claws. Tusks it might
  have, but as a matter of fact has not. There are, as in Artiodactyles
  generally, nineteen dorso-lumbar vertebrae; the long tail has numerous
  chevrons. The shoulder blade has a well-marked acromion and a distinct
  coracoid process; it is wide proximally. The bones of the fore-arm and
  fore-leg are, as is usual in primitive Artiodactyles, separate.</p>

  <p>In the skull the chief features, in addition to that mentioned in the
  definition of the family, are the large size of the paroccipital
  processes; there is no fossa lachrymalis or deficiency in the side of the
  face. The animal is three-toed, both in the fore- and hind-limbs. The
  second toe is nearly as large as the Artiodactyle third and fourth. There
  are tiny rudiments of the two remaining fingers. The hind-foot is also
  three-toed, and there is a trace of the hallux. The fingers are so widely
  separated and divergent from each other that it has been suggested that
  the animal had webbed feet and inhabited marshes, in which it swam by the
  aid of its long tail. The creature was the size of a Tapir.</p>

  <p>Closely resembling <i>Anoplotherium</i> are a number of other
  genera.</p>

  <p><i>Diplobune</i> ( = <i>Hyracodontotherium</i>) was much like the
  last, but was a more delicately-formed animal. The fingers and toes
  (three of each) end in such sharply-pointed phalanges that claws seem to
  be almost suggested. There are several species of this genus.
  <i>Dacrytherium</i> differs by the presence of a lachrymal fossa.</p>

  <p><i>Dichobune</i> has four-toed extremities, of which the lateral ones
  are more slender and shorter than the two middle ones. As in other
  Anoplotheriidae, the anterior premolars are furnished with a sharp
  cutting edge.</p>

<h5><b>Order V. SIRENIA.</b></h5>

  <p>Aquatic Mammalia, with but few scattered hairs; hind-limbs absent;
  fore-limbs paddle-shaped; tail flattened, and either <!-- Page 334
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page334"></a>{334}</span>Whale-like or
  rhomboidal to circular in form. Nostrils on upper surface of not
  specially-elongated snout. Clavicles are absent. The scapula has the
  normal mammalian form, with a well-developed and roughly median spine.
  The bones of the arm and hand articulate together, as in land animals;
  the phalanges show at most traces of increase in number above the normal.
  Pelvis represented by a vestige, more highly developed in some fossil
  than in recent forms. Stomach complex, consisting of several chambers.
  Lungs simple and not lobulated. Diaphragm oblique and very muscular.
  Brain peculiar in form and but slightly convoluted. Testes abdominal.
  Teats two, and pectoral in position. Placenta non-deciduous and zonary.<a
  name="NtA_214" href="#Nt_214"><sup>[214]</sup></a></p>

  <p>This limited group consists of purely aquatic forms, which are both
  marine and fresh-water in their proclivities. They have been placed in
  the immediate vicinity of the Whales; but it is now believed by most
  zoologists that the likenesses which they undoubtedly show to the Cetacea
  are of an adaptive kind and related to their similar mode of life. The
  group is a readily-definable one. Externally they are marked by their
  dark coloration, somewhat Whale-like though of clumsier build, and by the
  total absence of external ears and hind-limbs; the latter are, however,
  as will be pointed out shortly, marked by certain rudimentary bones.
  There is a flattened tail, which in the Dugong and <i>Rhytina</i> is
  precisely like that of a Whale. It is interesting to note that the former
  genus, whose tail is, judging it at least by the standard of the Whales,
  more completely modified for the aquatic life, should also show other
  features which indicate their longer life as marine creatures. For the
  flippers are more Whale-like in that the fore-arm is completely enclosed
  within the body, or nearly so, and the nostrils have a more decidedly
  superior position than in the Manatee. The fore-limbs of this group, as
  may be inferred from what has just been said, are flipper-like; but,
  contrary to what we find in Whales, the phalanges do not as a rule show
  any traces of multiplication, so characteristic a feature of the Cetacean
  hand, and the individual bones are connected by well-formed joints.
  Beneath the thick skin, which is sparsely provided with stout hairs in
  the Dugong, is a layer of blubber. Dr. Murie has called attention to the
  fact that this layer in the <!-- Page 335 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page335"></a>{335}</span>Manatee<a name="NtA_215"
  href="#Nt_215"><sup>[215]</sup></a> differs from the blubber of the Whale
  in that there is no free oil anywhere.<a name="NtA_216"
  href="#Nt_216"><sup>[216]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The skeleton of the Sirenia is strong and massive, thus contrasting
  with the loosely-textured bones of the Cetacea. The cervical vertebrae
  are, as a rule, free, but the second and third are fused in
  <i>Manatus</i> and the extinct <i>Halitherium</i>. It is noteworthy that
  in <i>Rhytina</i> the cervical vertebrae have the exceedingly thin centra
  that characterises the neck vertebrae in Whales. The ribs are most of
  them firmly articulated by two heads. The breastbone is generally
  reduced, as in Whales; and but few ribs are attached thereto. The
  vertebrae, moreover, are well locked together by zygapophyses, and not
  loosely attached as in Whales.</p>

  <p>The shoulder blade is long and narrow, and not unlike that of the
  Seals. It is totally unlike the peculiarly-modified scapula of the Whale
  tribe. But, as in the latter, there are no clavicles.</p>

  <p>The hind-limbs are only represented by the pelvis; and this is a
  rudimentary structure, varying, however, in the degree of its
  degeneration. That of the extinct <i>Halitherium</i> recalls the pelvis
  of the Rorqual. There is a single triradiate bone with an acetabular
  cavity for the rudiment of the femur in the centre; it suggests that here
  the three normal elements of the pelvis have become fused into a single
  bone. In the Dugong there are two small bones on each side.</p>

  <p>The Manatees (<i>Manatus</i>)<a name="NtA_217"
  href="#Nt_217"><sup>[217]</sup></a> are found in the fresh-waters and
  along the Atlantic coasts of South America and Africa. It appears that
  there are four species, of which one only is African, the others
  American. Report asserts the former occurrence of this genus on the
  shores of St. Helena.</p>

  <p>The Manatee is provided with only six cervical vertebrae, a fact which
  distinguishes it from the other existing genera of its group. A
  remarkable feature which it exhibits is the large number of molar teeth.
  These apparently go on increasing indefinitely during its life, the
  suggestion being that they are worn away by the nature of the
  food&mdash;algae with much sand intermixed. As many as twenty molar teeth
  have been counted in one half of the jaw, and there is no reason to
  forbid the assumption that they <!-- Page 336 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page336"></a>{336}</span>may get still more numerous. This large
  number of grinding teeth is obviously suggestive of the Whales, with
  which the Sirenia are believed by some to be allied. It is at least a
  remarkable coincidence that these two aquatic groups of mammals should
  both have assumed the same indefinite tooth formula. It is correct to say
  assumed, since extinct forms of Manatees, such as <i>Halitherium</i> and
  <i>Prorastoma</i>, have not a continuous succession of molars. The brain
  of the Manatee is, contrary to the usual arrangement among aquatic
  mammals, smooth, and only marked by one or two fissures.</p>

  <p>The Manatee<a name="NtA_218" href="#Nt_218"><sup>[218]</sup></a> is
  black in colour, its thick skin being wrinkled. The animal is assisted in
  feeding by a curious mechanism of the upper lip; this is split in two,
  and the two halves, which are furnished with strong bristles, can play
  upon each other like the points of a pair of forceps. The flippers are
  furnished with nails, save in <i>M. inunguis</i>, but in the nailed forms
  it is not every finger which is thus armed.</p>

  <p><i>Halicore</i>,<a name="NtA_219" href="#Nt_219"><sup>[219]</sup></a>
  the Dugong, is an entirely Oriental and Australian <!-- Page 337 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page337"></a>{337}</span>form; there appears to
  be but a single species, though more than one name has been given to
  supposed distinct species. As already mentioned, it differs from the
  Manatee in the possession of a Whale-like tail; the nostrils, too, are
  more upon the upper surface of the head, and there are no nails upon the
  flipper. The peculiar cleft lip of the Manatee is not so well developed
  in the Dugong, but there are traces of it; and in the foetus the likeness
  to the Manatee in this respect is very striking. It would thus appear
  that <i>Halicore</i> is a stage in advance upon <i>Manatus</i>; that the
  remarkable mechanism of the lip of the latter has been possessed, but has
  been lost, by the Dugong. The skull of the Dugong is distinguished by the
  stout premaxillary bones, which bear a tusk in the male. In the female
  the tooth is there, but is lodged within the bone. This incisor has a
  milk forerunner. The back teeth of the Dugong (there are no canines) are
  few in number (four or five, even six), thus showing a gradual reduction
  when compared with <i>Manatus</i>; and this culminates in the toothless
  <i>Rhytina</i>. It is also interesting to notice that in the massive
  lower jaw there are traces of an incisor. Were this to be developed into
  a tusk, the jaw would present a curious resemblance to that of
  <i>Dinotherium</i>.</p>

  <p>The Dugong, <i>H. dugong</i>, has the reputation of being the original
  of the mermaid legends, since the young is held to the
  pectorally-situated breast with one flipper. "But it should be
  remembered," justly observes Dr. Blanford, "that stories of beings half
  man or woman, half fish, are as common in temperate as in tropical seas,
  and that some of them are more ancient than any European knowledge of the
  Dugong."</p>

  <p><b>Extinct Sirenians.</b>&mdash;The earliest genus that can be with
  certainty referred to this order is the Oligocene <i>Prorastoma</i>. This
  genus, though offering no particular skull-characters that assist in the
  determination of the much-debated affinities of the Sirenia, shows a
  remarkable condition of the teeth that may afford a clue. The species
  <i>P. veronense</i>, recently described by Mr. Lydekker,<a name="NtA_220"
  href="#Nt_220"><sup>[220]</sup></a> is founded upon a fragment of the
  skull which contains two teeth apparently representing the third and
  fourth upper milk molars. The interest attaching to these teeth lies in
  the fact that they clearly exhibit the buno-selenodont condition
  characteristic of certain early Artiodactyles, e.g.
  <i>Merycopotamus</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Halitherium</i> is a later genus, which is known by the nearly <!--
  Page 338 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page338"></a>{338}</span>complete skeleton. The skull is like that
  of other Sirenia, with the down-turned premaxillary region. But the nasal
  bones, lost, or at least rudimentary, in recent forms, are well
  developed; the likeness of ancient to living forms in this respect being
  exactly paralleled by the Zeuglodonts, when compared with recent Whales.
  The vertebral centra exhibit distinct epiphyses, which have disappeared
  in living Sirenians. The cervical vertebrae are seven, of which the
  second and third are occasionally fused. There are nineteen pairs of
  ribs, and there are three lumbar vertebrae. The sternum consists of three
  separate pieces. There is a rudimentary femur.</p>

  <p>The recently-extinct Steller's Sea-cow, belonging to the genus
  <i>Rhytina</i>, was a huge beast, seen in the flesh up to nearly the end
  of the last century. It frequented the shores of Bering's Straits. Its
  remains occur in the peat on the shores of those seas. It reaches a
  length of some 20 to 30 feet. The external characters were much like
  those of other recent Sirenians. The nostrils were above the fore part of
  the snout, the latter being truncated and obtuse. The tail was of the
  Cetacean pattern, and thus like that of <i>Halicore</i>. The head of this
  Sirenian was small, and the teeth had entirely vanished save for the
  apparent existence as transitory structures of two small incisors in the
  upper jaw. The absence of teeth was compensated by the presence of a
  horny palate for the trituration of the sea-weeds which constituted the
  food of Steller's Sea-cow. The fore-limbs seem to have possessed no
  nails, but were covered at the extremity with short, bristly hairs, no
  doubt serving the purpose of keeping the animal moored in safety to the
  slippery beds of Fucus upon which it browsed.</p>

  <p>There are nineteen pairs of ribs. The vertebrae of the cervical region
  are the customary seven, and the centra are thin and plate-like as in the
  Cetacea, the animal being thus short-necked like those marine
  creatures.</p>

<h6>CETACEA&mdash;WHALES AND DOLPHINS</h6>

<h5><b>Order VI. CETACEA.<a name="NtA_221" href="#Nt_221"><sup>[221]</sup></a></b></h5>

  <p>Aquatic Mammalia of fish-like form; tail expanded into horizontal
  flukes; a fatty dorsal "fin" present in most species; anterior limbs
  converted into fin-like paddles; posterior limbs only represented by
  skeletal rudiments. Hairy covering reduced to a few isolated hairs in the
  neighbourhood of the muzzle. Nostrils represented by the single or double
  blow-hole, nearly always situated far back upon the skull. Bones of loose
  texture and much impregnated with oil. The skull has a greatly-developed
  facial portion; supra-occipital bones meeting the frontal by overgrowing,
  or growing in between the parietals; bones surrounding the organ of
  hearing loosely attached to the skull, the tympanics of peculiar
  cowrie-shell form. Coronoid process of mandible absent, or very feebly
  developed. Teeth, when present, few or numerous, always of simple conical
  form, with at most traces of additional cusps (<i>Inia</i>); if absent
  their place taken by whalebone. Cervical vertebrae of short
  antero-posterior diameter, often more or less completely welded together
  into a single mass. Articulations between dorsal and other vertebrae
  feeble. Scapula peculiarly flattened; acromion strongly developed as a
  rule, but arising from a slightly-marked spine; coracoid process
  generally strongly developed. Phalanges of digits always more numerous
  than in other mammals. Clavicles absent. Stomach complex, consisting of
  at least four and often more chambers. Lungs simple and non-lobulated.
  Diaphragm obliquely set and very <!-- Page 340 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page340"></a>{340}</span>muscular. Brain much
  expanded transversely and well convoluted. Testes abdominal. Teats two,
  inguinal in position. Placenta diffuse and non-deciduate.</p>

  <p>The Whales and Dolphins, which constitute this order, form an
  assemblage which is easily characterised by reason of the fact that their
  affinities to other groups of Mammalia are so doubtful that they furnish
  matter rather for speculation than for authoritative statement. Some hold
  that they resemble in certain points the Ungulata; while others again see
  in them the culminating term of a series which commences with such a form
  as the Otter, and of which the Seals and Sea-lions are intermediate
  stages. A third opinion is that the Whales have arisen from some low
  mammalian stock, too primitive to be assigned to any existing order of
  mammals. Palaeontology, as will be seen later, throws no light whatever
  upon their origin. This matter has already been referred to (see p. <a
  href="#page120">120</a>) in considering the position of the Cetacea.</p>

  <p>The Whales include the most gigantic of all the orders of vertebrated
  animals. No creature living or extinct is so large as the Sibbald's
  Rorqual, which attains to a length of some 85 feet, or perhaps even
  rather more. On the other hand we have what are by comparison minute
  forms. Apart from the possibly problematical <i>Delphinus minutus</i>,
  stated to be only 2 feet in length, we have as a minimum 3 or 4 feet. The
  size of the Cetacea has been subjected to much exaggeration. The first
  duty of a Whale, observed the late Sir William Flower, is to be large;
  and Natural Historians, in the recent as well as in the remote past, have
  not hesitated to put very round numbers upon the dimensions of the larger
  members of the order. We may perhaps pass over Pliny's "fish called
  balaena or whirlpool, which is so long and broad as to take up more in
  length and breadth than two acres of ground," and a number of analogous
  exaggerations, which gradually dwindled down to the dimensions just
  stated of the great Rorqual. M. Pouchet has made the ingenious suggestion
  that the statements of the ancients may have been nearer the truth than
  observations of to-day would have us believe; he pointed out justly that
  in former times Whales were not so relentlessly pursued as during the
  last century; the inference being that they may have lived to a greater
  age, and attained a more colossal bulk. The more modern exaggerations in
  the <!-- Page 341 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page341"></a>{341}</span>dimensions of the bigger Whales are
  probably due to the fact that measurements have been taken, not in a
  straight line from snout to tail, but along the bulging sides of the
  Cetacean, rendered even more convex than in nature by decomposition, and
  by pressure due to the immense tonnage of the creature.</p>

  <p>The Cetacea are the most perfectly aquatic of all mammals; they never
  leave the waters which they inhabit. It is true that legends have
  represented them as pasturing upon the shore&mdash;Aelian spoke of
  Dolphins basking in the sun's rays upon the sand; and the "Devil Fish" of
  California, <i>Rhachianectes</i> (see p. <a href="#page357">357</a>) has
  given rise to improbable stories&mdash;but they are apparently only
  legends. Indeed a stranded Whale cannot live long, for it is unable to
  breathe, the comparatively feeble breast being crushed by its own weight.
  In accordance with the purely aquatic habit, we find a modification of
  the outward form of the body (and as we shall see later of many of the
  internal organs), which renders the Cetacea externally unlike all other
  mammals. The form is fish-like, the fore-limbs are paddles, the tail is
  expanded into two horizontal flukes, which serve to propel the creature
  through the water.</p>

  <p>The skin is smooth and shiny, so smooth and so shiny that it has often
  been compared to coach leather. But nevertheless they are not entirely
  without that most essential character of the class Mammalia, a coating of
  hair. The hairy covering is, however, reduced to the very smallest
  proportions; it is represented <!-- Page 342 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page342"></a>{342}</span>by a few hairs only&mdash;so few that they
  can be counted with ease&mdash;in the neighbourhood of the muzzle. These
  hairs are not present in all Whales; they are absent, for example, in the
  White Whale or Beluga. When present they are not furnished either with
  sebaceous glands or with muscular fibres, which are such universal
  concomitants of the hair follicles in the Mammalia generally. This
  appears to be conclusive evidence that the hairs, few as they are, are
  still undergoing degeneration. The need for a furry coat is removed by
  the presence of a thick coating of fat immediately underlying the skin.
  This is known as the blubber, and is the main incentive to the pursuit of
  Whales. It must not, however, be assumed without further argument that
  the hair is absent because its place is taken, as a mechanism for
  retaining the heat, by the blubber; for the Seal tribe possess both fur
  and blubber. Another conceivable explanation is quite at variance with
  such a view of economy. It may be noticed that among Ungulates there is a
  tendency to lose hair, particularly among more or less aquatic forms.
  Thus the Hippopotamus is almost naked (as is indeed the Walrus); the
  Rhinoceros, too, often a frequenter of marshy soil, is almost as denuded
  as is the Hippopotamus. It is not, however, settled that the Whales have
  anything to do with the Ungulata; otherwise an additional argument might
  be used, that is, the secular loss of hair in some members of this group.
  The Hairy Rhinoceros, <i>Rh. tichorhinus</i>, was, as its name denotes, a
  hairy beast; the Mammoth was equally so. The descendants, or at least the
  modern representatives of both these creatures, are but scantily clad
  with hairs.</p>

  <p>A final reason for the naked character of the skin in existing Cetacea
  is closely connected with a feature in the organisation of three or four
  living species which must first be described.</p>

  <p>Some years ago the late Dr. J. E. Gray of the British Museum described
  from the sea, off Margate, what he considered to be a new species of
  Porpoise, characterised by the presence on the dorsal fin of a row of
  stony tubercles. As a matter of fact it was subsequently shown that the
  Common Porpoise has the same structures, so that there was no need for a
  Margate species, <i>Phocaena tuberculifera</i>. Moreover, in the Indian
  <i>Neomeris</i>, a close ally of the Porpoise, a more abundant calcified
  covering of scales exists along the whole back of the animal. These
  plates, <!-- Page 343 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page343"></a>{343}</span>it has been discovered, are larger in the
  foetus, a fact which naturally points to their being an inheritance from
  the past, now undergoing retrogressive changes. Such a way of looking
  upon the facts is confirmed by the finding, many years ago, by the
  naturalist and physiologist Johannes Müller, of bony plates in connexion
  with the remains of a Zeuglodont Cetacean. It looks, therefore, very much
  as if the Eocene ancestors of the modern Cetacea had a skin studded with
  bony plates, as have the armadillos. This being the case, the
  disappearance of hair is not surprising. The room would be taken up by
  the calcified plates, and when the latter disappeared, as they have in
  the vast majority of existing Whales, the naked skin alone would be
  left.</p>

  <p>Whales possess no externally-visible hind-limbs; rudiments of these
  appendages are present, which will be dealt with under the description of
  the principal features of the skeleton. But it has been discovered that
  in the Porpoise, external vestiges of hind-limbs do appear in the foetus,
  a fact which, be it observed, does away with the old view that the flukes
  of the Whale are the last term in the series of vanishing hind-limbs, of
  which the Seals, with their hind-limbs and tail bound up together, offer
  an intermediate step.</p>

  <p>The tail is fish-like in form, but the flukes are horizontal instead
  of vertical as in fishes and <i>Ichthyosaurus</i>. This arrangement is no
  doubt associated with the need for rapid return to the surface waters
  after a prolonged immersion in search of food. A downward stroke, such as
  is given by the powerful and large tail flukes, would naturally bring
  about this result rapidly. The tail, moreover, is under all circumstances
  the swimming organ. Its motion has been stated to be slightly rotatory,
  like that of a screw, and it is the case that the two flukes are often
  alternate in shape like the flanges of a screw; one being convex upwards,
  the other convex downwards.</p>

  <p>The fore-limbs are in the form of paddles, but they do not apparently
  serve as organs of locomotion so much as balancers. When a Whale is
  killed, it falls over on to one side, the office of the flippers being to
  maintain the proper position. It is believed, however, from the fact that
  the embryo often shows a relatively larger pectoral fin than that of the
  adult&mdash;the difference being due to a reduction in the adult of the
  number of phalanges&mdash;that the fin was once an organ of progression.
  <!-- Page 344 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page344"></a>{344}</span></p>

  <p>The pectoral fin of Whales exists in two forms. In the Toothed Whales
  it is shorter and rounder; in the Whalebone Whales longer and narrower.
  Structural differences accompany these outward dissimilarities. In the
  first-named group the humerus and the beginning of the radius and ulna
  are within the body, and do not form a part of the fin. In the Whalebone
  Whales, on the other hand, the fin contains all the bones of the
  fore-limb. Another remarkable contrast between the hand in the two groups
  of Whales is that while the Toothed Whales have five fingers, thus
  justifying the prevailing opinion that they are the more primitive of the
  two groups, the Whalebone Whales have only four fingers. Actually the
  Right Whale, <i>Balaena</i>, seems to have five fingers; and, indeed, the
  fact that it has, is often used to distinguish it from the Humpback,
  which has undoubtedly only four. But a careful consideration of the state
  of affairs which prevails in the foetus of <i>Balaenoptera</i> dispels
  this idea. Between what are apparently the second and third fingers, a
  rudimentary finger, consisting of four phalanges, appears. This is not
  produced, as is an additional finger found in the White Whale or Beluga,
  by a splitting of a finger. Accordingly the four-fingered condition of
  the Whalebone Whales is produced by the dropping out of a finger in the
  middle of the series,&mdash;a very remarkable fact. When fingers
  disappear, as, for <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'intsance'"
  >instance</span>, in the Horse, etc., it is at the two ends of the series
  that the digits vanish. If this view of Professor Kükenthal's<a
  name="NtA_222" href="#Nt_222"><sup>[222]</sup></a> be accepted, it
  follows that the presumed thumb of the Right Whale is what has been
  termed the prepollex.</p>

  <p>The hand of the Whales, like those of some other aquatic creatures,
  <i>e.g.</i> the reptile <i>Ichthyosaurus</i>, has a larger number of
  phalanges than have terrestrial animals. The result of this is, of
  course, to increase the length of the fin and its utility as a paddle. It
  is commonly not all the fingers that have developed this great number of
  accessory phalanges. Rudimentary nails have been found upon the Cetacean
  hand; but in no case are they functionally developed. In the Manatees we
  have the disappearance of the nails still imperfectly accomplished. In
  <i>M. latirostris</i> there are nails; these have vanished, apart from
  possible traces to be seen with a microscope, in <i>M. inunguis</i>.</p>

  <p>A very characteristic feature of certain Whales are the furrows <!--
  Page 345 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page345"></a>{345}</span>to be
  seen on the throat. This is especially the case with the Rorquals, in
  which group the Humpback Whale, <i>Megaptera</i>, is to be included. The
  whales of these two genera (<i>Balaenoptera</i> and <i>Megaptera</i>)
  have a large number of the throat furrows&mdash;as many as sixty have
  been counted. Some other Whales have a smaller number; thus
  <i>Rhachianectes</i> has but two on each side, and the Physeteridae have
  not many more. These furrows are absent in very young embryos. It is
  thought by Professor Kükenthal that they allow of a wide opening of the
  mouth.</p>

  <p>The blow-hole of Whales is, of course, the aperture of the nostrils,
  which are not so far back in the foetus as in the adult. By the
  characters of the nostrils the Toothed Whales can be distinguished from
  the Baleen Whales; in the latter the orifice is double, in the former
  single. In embryos of Dolphins, however, the two apertures are quite
  independent. The phenomena of spouting have often been misinterpreted.<a
  name="NtA_223" href="#Nt_223"><sup>[223]</sup></a> When the Whale
  breathes, the expired air rushes out through the nostrils. The water
  vapour in the breath condenses into drops of water in the cold Arctic
  regions where the phenomenon has been mainly observed. Hence the idea
  that water taken in at the mouth is expelled through the blow-hole. As
  the Whale approaches the surface to breathe, it may be that some of the
  water of the sea is <!-- Page 346 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page346"></a>{346}</span>driven upwards by the forcible expulsion
  of air from the lungs. But for the most part the water which is spouted
  is simply condensed breath.</p>

  <p>Like some, but not all, other aquatic Mammalia the Whales have
  apparently no external ear. Indeed the opening of the ear is excessively
  small. In a huge Rorqual it will "admit a quill"; and although "a quill"
  is rather vague, we may fairly allow any sized quill without proving that
  the orifice of the auditory passage is anything but exceedingly minute.
  As a proof, added to so many, that the Whales are the progeny of
  terrestrial creatures, we have the occasional traces of external ears.<a

<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 182.&mdash;Left lower jaw of foetus of <i>Balaenoptera rostrata</i>. Inner aspect,
natural size, showing teeth. (After Julin.)</p>

  <p>Whalebone Whales never possess permanent teeth as well as the baleen;
  but in the foetus are more than traces of true teeth, which, however,
  never arrive at maturity. The whalebone itself is described later (p. <a
  href="#page354">354</a>). That the Whalebone Whales possess teeth while
  in the foetal condition was discovered so long ago as 1807. It has since
  been confirmed by many observers. Not only is there one set of teeth
  developed in the foetal <i>Balaenoptera</i> but two, of which one comes
  to a greater maturity; the other, in fact, remaining at a very early
  stage of development. The more complete dentition belongs to the milk
  series, as is the case with the Toothed Whales. A very interesting
  conclusion with regard to the derivation of the simple conical teeth of
  Whales seems to follow from the development of these structures in
  Balaenoptera. There are in the young foetus fewer teeth than in the more
  advanced embryo. Now in the younger embryo some of the teeth are
  furnished with more than one cusp; they are bi- or even tri-conodont. As
  Sir R. Owen observed, the teeth&mdash;some of <!-- Page 347 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page347"></a>{347}</span>them&mdash;are
  literally double teeth. This is a suggestion of the more complicated
  teeth of the Zeuglodonts, and shows so far that the simple conical teeth
  of existing Whales (cf. however the Platanistidae) are not by any manner
  of means so primitive as their actual structure would undoubtedly lead
  one to believe. Further than this, the greater number of teeth in the
  older embryo coincided with the disappearance of these double teeth,
  which seem to split up into the simple conical teeth.</p>

  <p>The Toothed Whales are not furnished with baleen, but with teeth only.
  These teeth are more or less numerous, their arrangement being of value
  in the classification of the group; a matter which is dealt with
  later.</p>

  <p>In the Narwhal, whose dentition in the adult is reduced to the
  well-known tusk or tusks (properly developed only in the male), there is
  a complete foetal dentition. A very curious fact has been elucidated by
  Professor Kükenthal about the dentition of the Common Porpoise. It
  appears that in this Cetacean the two teeth corresponding to each other
  of the two dentitions may fuse into a single tooth, which has in
  consequence a double crown. It may be that this is the case with the
  Platanistid <i>Inia</i>, and that its diconodont teeth are not,
  therefore, a reminiscence of the comparatively complicated teeth of the
  ancient Zeuglodonts.</p>

  <p>The internal organs of Whales which show the greatest peculiarities as
  compared with other mammals are the stomach, the lungs, and the
  diaphragm. Whales always possess a complicated stomach divided into many,
  but into a variable number of, chambers: there are as few as four in
  some, as many as fourteen in Ziphioids.</p>

  <p>On account of its complication the stomach<a name="NtA_225"
  href="#Nt_225"><sup>[225]</sup></a> has been compared to that of
  Ruminants&mdash;it has even been alleged that Whales "ruminate"&mdash;but
  the comparison will not hold good. Nor, on the other hand, is there a
  very close resemblance to the equally-complicated stomach of the
  Sirenians.</p>

  <p>The Rorqual has a stomach with as few compartments as any. The only
  Whale which appears to have fewer is <i>Balaena mysticetus</i>, where
  there are but three. In the Rorqual the oesophagus opens into a more or
  less globular sac; from the upper end of this, <i>i.e.</i> close to the
  entry of the oesophagus, arises the second chamber, long and narrowish;
  then follows an extremely short third sac, <!-- Page 348 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page348"></a>{348}</span>then a larger fourth,
  after which comes the dilated commencement of the small intestine. The
  latter might be regarded as a chamber of the stomach were it not for the
  fact that the ducts of the liver and the pancreas open into it. This
  represents one type of the Cetacean stomach, which seems to be found in
  all Whales except the Ziphioids. In the latter, the oesophagus opens into
  the first compartment as usual; but the second division of the stomach
  arises not close to the entrance of the oesophagus, but at the opposite
  end. It would seem, therefore, as if the first division of the stomach,
  found in most Whales, were missing in Ziphioids. This way of looking at
  the matter is confirmed by the fact that in <i>Hyperoodon</i> a remnant
  of the missing first stomach is found in the shape of a small
  diverticulum of the oesophagus just before it enters the stomach.</p>

  <p>The essential difference between the Whale's and the Ruminant's
  stomach is this: in the latter the stomach is primarily divided into two
  portions, of which the first is non-digestive and is clothed with
  oesophageal epithelium. The second, the abomasum, is the digestive
  region. The first part is again divided into three compartments. In the
  Whales, on the other hand, it is the digestive part which is again
  subdivided, while if the first part is divided it is not markedly so as
  in the Ruminants.</p>

  <p>The lungs are remarkable for their unlobulated character; in this they
  agree with the lungs of the Sirenia. The thoracic cavity in which they
  lie is barrel-shaped, and not, as is usual in terrestrial mammals,
  boat-shaped, <i>i.e.</i> narrower sternally than above. The alteration of
  the shape of the thoracic cavity is associated with the aquatic life; so
  at any rate the fact that it is also marked in Seals and even in the
  Otter seems to show. The Whales are also characterised by the great
  obliquity of the diaphragm, which is extremely muscular. In this
  character again we find an agreement with the Sirenia, and also with
  other aquatic mammals; it is not therefore a character of Whales so much
  as evidence of an adaptation to the aquatic life. The advantage is, it
  appears, in the increased capacity of the thoracic cavity, and the
  consequent greater possibilities of expansion of the lungs, which it must
  be remembered serve as hydrostatic as well as breathing organs.</p>

  <p>Some of the internal arteries of Whales break up into retia mirabilia.
  Their kidneys are lobulated; whether this has <!-- Page 349 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page349"></a>{349}</span>anything to do with the
  aquatic life is not so clear. It also characterises the Sirenia, more or
  less, and the Otters; but, on the other hand, the terrestrial Bears show
  the same structure as do also some Ungulates. It must be borne in mind,
  too, that the kidneys of foetal Man are lobulated.</p>

  <p>The liver is a compact organ not showing such lobulation as is common,
  but not universal, among mammals.</p>

  <p>The bones of Whales have a somewhat loose structure, and are much
  impregnated with oil. In many features the skeleton of Whales is highly
  distinctive of the order.</p>

  <p>The brain case is small proportionately and rounded. The "face" is
  therefore long, and in some cases, especially among the fossil forms of
  Platanistidae, the rostrum is extraordinarily elongated. The asymmetry of
  the Whale's skull is one of its most remarkable features; this, however,
  is entirely limited to the Toothed Whales, and among them is more
  pronounced in some forms than in others. Thus the Platanistidae and many
  Ziphioids are not nearly so asymmetrical as the <!-- Page 350 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page350"></a>{350}</span>Dolphins and,
  especially, <i>Physeter</i>. This asymmetry affects particularly the
  premaxillae, the maxillae, and the nasals. The base of the skull is
  symmetrical. The Whale's skull has very long premaxillae which, however,
  do not, except in the extinct Zeuglodonts, bear any teeth. The nasal
  bones, whether symmetrical or the reverse, are very small in existing
  Whales, which arrangement, together with the long and broad maxillary
  bones, removes the anterior nostrils, the blow-hole, far backwards. The
  roof of the skull is not at all formed by the parietals externally. These
  bones form a portion of the side of the cranium, but are replaced or
  covered by the <!-- Page 351 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page351"></a>{351}</span>enormously-developed supra-occipital in
  the adult. Here again the Zeuglodonts are more typically Mammalian, for
  in them the parietals have a normal development and situation, rising
  even into a median crest as in so many quadrupeds. The bones related to
  the organ of hearing, the tympanis and petrous bones, are very solid and
  dense in structure. Moreover they are but loosely attached to surrounding
  bones, and are thus easily and frequently lost. Nearly the only mammals
  which resemble the Whales in the fact that the pterygoids sometimes meet
  in the middle line below are the Edentata (Anteater and Armadillo, see p.
  <a href="#page167">167</a>). But in both groups this peculiarity is not

  <p>The vertebral column is remarkable for the fact that more or fewer of
  the cervical vertebrae may be fused together into a short and compact
  mass. This is seen at its maximum in the genera <i>Balaena</i> and
  <i>Neobalaena</i>. The odontoid process of the second <!-- Page 352
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page352"></a>{352}</span>vertebra,
  though hardly at all marked, is nevertheless really present and developed
  from a bony centre of its own, as in other mammals. The dorsal and lumbar
  vertebrae are, of course, to be distinguished by the presence of ribs
  attached to the former; but as there is only a rudimentary pelvis, not
  attached to the vertebral column, no sacral region can be detected. The

  <p>The sternum in the Whale tribe is much more modified in the Whalebone
  Whales than in the Odontocetes. In the latter it is made up of several
  pieces, as in other mammals, which often, however, become coalesced. In
  the Mystacoceti this bone is a single piece, to which only one pair of
  ribs is attached, and its <!-- Page 353 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page353"></a>{353}</span>form is characteristic of the genus. It is
  heart-shaped, more or less, in <i>Balaena</i>, and somewhat cross- or
  <img src="images/t.png" class="middle" style="height:2ex;" alt="T"
  />-shaped in the genus <i>Balaenoptera</i>. In the Odontocetes the ribs
  have, some of them, the normal attachment by capitulum and tuberculum. In
  the Mystacocetes the attachment, where it exists, is very loose, and the
  tuberculum alone is attached to its vertebra. This allows of the freer
  play of the ribs during respiration. The scapula has a very
  characteristic form in these animals. The acromion, where it exists, is
  placed near the anterior margin of the shoulder blade, and overlaps the
  generally long coracoid process. Clavicles are totally absent. The pelvis
  is very rudimentary, consisting merely of a single bonelet, to which are
  attached the rudiments (in some cases) of a femur, and, in <i>Balaena</i>
  (Fig. 188), of a tibia also.</p>

  <p>Whales are to be divided into three great groups<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span>(1) the Whalebone Whales or Mystacoceti; (2)
  the Toothed Whales or Odontoceti; and (3) the entirely-extinct
  Archaeoceti or Zeuglodonts.</p>

<h5><span class="sc">Sub-Order 1.</span> MYSTACOCETI.</h5>

  <p>This division is thus characterised<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span>Teeth are never functionally developed; they
  are present in the young, but replaced in the adult by the baleen or
  whalebone; the external respiratory aperture is double; the skull is
  perfectly symmetrical; the rami of the mandible are arched outwards and
  do not form a true symphysis; the sternum is always composed of a single
  piece of bone; the ribs articulate only with the transverse processes of
  the vertebrae.</p>

  <p>The Mystacoceti are nearly invariably huge creatures, the sole
  exceptions being the Pygmy Right Whale, <i>Neobalaena</i>, and <!-- Page
  354 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page354"></a>{354}</span>a small
  Rorqual. But even these are larger than the majority of Toothed
  Whales.</p>

  <p>The most characteristic feature by which the Whalebone Whales are to
  be distinguished from other Whales is that which gives to them their
  name, the presence of whalebone. Whalebone is a horny product of the
  epithelium lining the mouth, and is comparable to an exaggeration of the
  transverse ridges which are found in the mouths of all mammals upon the
  palate. In non-Cetacean mammals these ridges vary in depth, and are
  arranged as a rule transversely, but with an oblique inclination. This is
  precisely how the plates of baleen are disposed in the mouth of a Whale.
  Each piece of "bone" is triangular in shape, the broader end being that
  of attachment while it narrows gradually; the inner side of the blades is
  frayed out into a number of threads which form the straining apparatus.
  The plates vary in length up to as great an extreme length as 13 feet,
  which occurs in the Right Whale at times. The colour is black or paler,
  even white. The number of these plates in the mouth is very great. As
  many as 370 blades have been counted. They diminish in length towards
  both ends of the series. Though whalebone has been in use for a long
  period, whence the whalebone came was formerly one of those things not
  generally known.</p>

  <p>A very prevalent notion was that the whalebone formed the eyelids or
  perhaps the eyelashes of the creature. Scaliger, commenting upon
  Aristotle, held that the whale had "lamellae upon the eyebrows, which,
  when the head is plunged below the surface, were raised by the water; but
  when the animal raised its head <!-- Page 355 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page355"></a>{355}</span>above the waves the lamellae fell and
  covered the eyes." Whalebone, too, has been often spoken of as "the fin
  of a whale," "the finnes that stand forth of their mouths." The value of
  whalebone is still great, in spite of various substitutes which are now
  used in its place. In the year 1897, for example, the value of this
  article was £2000 per ton. As a single Whale may produce several tons of
  this material, it is not surprising to find that the results of a whaling
  voyage may be very profitable.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Balaenopteridae.</b>&mdash;This genus <i>Balaenoptera</i>
  includes the Rorquals, which are Whalebone Whales of large size,
  differing from the Right Whales in three important external characters:
  the head is comparatively small; there is a dorsal fin; the throat is
  marked by numerous longitudinal furrows. The bones of the cranium are not
  so arched as in the Right Whales, and as a consequence the plates of
  baleen are shorter. The hand is only four-fingered. The cervical
  vertebrae are for the most part all free. One of the earliest records of
  a Whale stranded in the Thames was probably of a species of this genus in
  the year 1658, and is thus described by John Evelyn<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span>"A large whale was taken betwixt my land
  butting on the Thames and Greenewich, which drew an infinite concourse to
  see it, by water, horse, coach, and on foot, from London and all
  parts.... It was killed with a harping yron, struck in the head, out of
  which spouted blood and water by two tunnells, and after an horrid grone
  it ran quite on shore and died. Its length was 58 foot, heighth 16; black
  skinn'd like coach leather, very small eyes, greate taile, onely two
  small finns, a picked snout, and a mouth so wide that divers men might
  have stood upright in it; no teeth, but suck'd slime onely as thro' a
  grate of that bone which we call whalebone, the throate yet so narrow as
  would not have admitted the least of fishes ... all of it prodigious, but
  in nothing more wonderful that an animal of so greate a bulk should be
  nourished onely by slime thro' those grates."</p>

  <p>Professor Collett has recently given<a name="NtA_226"
  href="#Nt_226"><sup>[226]</sup></a> an elaborate account of the
  characters and habits of this great Whale (<i>Balaenoptera musculus</i>).
  Though a large beast (44 to 67 feet in length) it is exceeded by other
  Rorquals; it is of a dark grey blue colour above, white, for the most
  part, below. The dorsal fin is large and high; the flippers relatively
  slender and small. The whole throat from the <!-- Page 356 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page356"></a>{356}</span>symphysis of the jaws
  to the middle of the belly is, as in other species, marked by furrows,
  forty to fifty-eight in number. The hairy covering is reduced (in an
  adult female) to thirteen hairs on each side of the lower jaw; in a
  foetus there were also seven hairs on each side of the upper jaw, as well
  as rather more on the lower jaw&mdash;altogether, forty-eight. This Whale
  appears to feed chiefly upon small Crustacea, especially the Copepod,
  <i>Calanus finmarchicus</i>. The number of baleen plates is about 330 on
  each side of the jaw. This Whale sometimes swims singly, but usually in
  schools of even as many as fifty.</p>

  <p>Rudolphi's Rorqual (<i>B. borealis</i>) seems to be a perfectly
  inoffensive beast; it is said to be able to stay under water for as long
  a time as twelve hours.</p>

  <p>A smaller species than the last is <i>B. rostrata</i>&mdash;at the
  outside 33 feet in length. Here the hairy covering is reduced<a
  name="NtA_227" href="#Nt_227"><sup>[227]</sup></a> to "two small hairs on
  the integument covering the apex of the lower maxilla." The colour is
  greyish black above, the underside white. On the other hand, <i>B.
  sibbaldii</i>, the Blue Whale, is the giant of its race, reaching a
  length of 85 feet. Its colour is a dark bluish grey, with small whitish
  spots on the breast. The dorsal fin is small and low with straight
  margins.</p>

  <p><i>B. musculus</i>, the Finner, is intermediate in size&mdash;not more
  than 70 feet. It seems doubtful whether the "sulphur bottom," <i>B.
  australis</i>, of Antarctica and <i>B. patachonica</i> differ
  specifically from this.<a name="NtA_228"
  href="#Nt_228"><sup>[228]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The genus <i>Megaptera</i> is very near <i>Balaenoptera</i>, but
  differs from it mainly in the following external and internal characters.
  The dorsal fin is not very prominent, and its place is taken by a lowish
  hump, whence, indeed, the common name of this Whale, "Humpback." The
  pectoral fin is unusually long, and the creature uses it to beat itself,
  the surrounding water, and, more playfully, its mates. The general
  outline of this Cetacean is more clumsy than that of <i>Balaenoptera</i>.
  The most important internal difference is in the form of the scapula,
  which has at most a slight acromion and coracoid process. These are
  rather more pronounced, according to Messrs. van Beneden and Gervais,<a
  name="NtA_229" href="#Nt_229"><sup>[229]</sup></a> <!-- Page 357 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page357"></a>{357}</span>in the southern form of
  the genus, which is known as <i>M. lalandii</i>. The head, it should also
  be remarked, is studded with large tubercles about the size of an orange,
  which seem to be hyper-trophied rudiments of the hairs, which should be
  present in this region of the body. As is the case with other Whales,
  numerous species have been made out of individuals of <i>Megaptera</i>.
  Captain Scammon, who observed many "gams" or herds of these Whales,
  remarked<a name="NtA_230" href="#Nt_230"><sup>[230]</sup></a> that he had
  extreme difficulty in finding any two individuals precisely alike! The
  best-known species in any case is the northern <i>M. longimana</i>, which
  occurs on our own coasts. The genus is, like so many Cetaceans,
  world-wide in range; and it is possible that the difference in the
  scapula already referred to may justify the separation of a southern
  <i>M. lalandii</i> (with which in that case, perhaps, <i>M. capensis</i>
  and <i>M. novae zelandiae</i> will be synonymous). Quite recently M.
  Gervais has insisted upon a <i>Megaptera indica</i> from the Persian
  Gulf. <i>Megaptera</i> grows to a length of 50 to 60 feet. Seventy-five
  feet have been stated, but measurements of Whales have usually to be
  received with caution.</p>

  <p><i>Rhachianectes</i>, with but one species, <i>R. glaucus</i>,<a
  name="NtA_231" href="#Nt_231"><sup>[231]</sup></a> the "Californian Grey
  Whale," is the last genus of the family Balaenopteridae. This Whale is
  but imperfectly known anatomically; but quite sufficient has been
  ascertained to show its great divergence from <i>Balaenoptera</i> or
  <i>Megaptera</i>. The dorsal fin is completely absent, and the throat
  pleats, so characteristic of the typical Balaenopteridae, are reduced to
  two. It has, however, the general outline of a Rorqual, with a relatively
  small head. In osteological characters it tends to unite the two families
  Balaenopteridae and Balaenidae (if they are really necessary
  subdivisions). The skull is on the whole Rorqual-like; but its fore-part
  is narrow as in the Greenland Whale, and the premaxillaries are pinched
  up in the middle line so as to be visible from the side; this again is a
  Balaenid character. The cervical vertebrae are free as in Rorquals, and
  the sternum is quite as in that group. The scapula has more the shape of
  that of <i>Balaena</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Rhachianectes glaucus</i> is confined to the Pacific, and has been
  extensively hunted from the shore. It is not, however, a very valuable
  Whale, since the baleen is short as in Rorquals, and the <!-- Page 358
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page358"></a>{358}</span>beast,
  moreover, appears to be fierce, a somewhat rare attribute of Whales. It
  has been spoken of, indeed, as "a cunning, courageous, and vicious"
  animal. <i>Rhachianectes</i> is essentially a coast Whale, and loves to
  lie in the surf in quite shallow water waiting for the tide to float it
  off. This Whale varies much in colour from black to mottled grey and
  black, and reaches a length of about 40 feet.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Balaenidae.</b>&mdash;The Right Whales of the genus
  <i>Balaena</i> are to be distinguished from <i>Neobalaena</i> and from
  the Rorquals by the following characters<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>The size is large, 50 to 60 feet. There is no dorsal fin. The head is
  more than or nearly one-fourth of the entire length of the animal. The
  baleen is very long. The throat is not grooved. The orbital process of
  the frontal is not wider than the downward process of the maxilla. The
  cervical vertebrae are all fused. The scapula is rather high. The
  hind-limb has the rudiment of a tibia. The intestine has no caecum.</p>

  <p>A vast number of different genera have been founded on detached bones,
  bits of whalebone, and more or less complete skeletons of Right Whales
  coming from different parts of the world. In Dr. Gray's catalogues we
  find the following allowed, viz. <i>Balaena</i>, <i>Eubalaena</i>,
  <i>Hunterius</i>, <i>Caperea</i>, <i>Macleayius</i>. The number of
  "species" distributed among the genera is some thirteen or more, with
  whose names we shall not trouble the reader. As a matter of fact there
  are not more than two species which can with certainty be identified and
  distinguished, both of which are so close that they cannot possibly be
  placed but in the same genus, <i>Balaena</i>. In no group of
  Whales&mdash;in no group of animals probably&mdash;has imagination run
  riot to so terrible an extent in the formation of genera and species as
  in these Right Whales. This multiplication or rather division of genera
  has arisen from an old idea that Whales coming from different seas must
  be of different kinds, a notion now thoroughly exploded.</p>

  <p>The term "Right Whale" simply means that the Whales of this genus are
  the right kind of Whale for the whaler to pursue. Their whalebone is
  longer and more valuable, while the oil is not only more abundant but of
  a superior quality. The two species demand a separate account.</p>

  <p>The Greenland Whale, <i>Balaena mysticetus</i>, is one of the rare
  instances of a Whale which has an exceedingly limited range in <!-- Page
  359 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page359"></a>{359}</span>space. It
  is absolutely confined to the Arctic Ocean, and reported occurrences on
  our coasts are due to a confusion with <i>B. australis</i>, to be
  presently described. At the "Devil's Dyke," near Brighton, there is, or
  was, the skull of a most flagrant Rorqual, which is carefully labelled
  "Greenland Whale." This Whale grows to a length of 50, 60, rarely 70
  feet. It is black in colour, save for a white patch on the under side of
  the jaw. The head is quite one-third of the body in length. There are a
  few scattered hairs at the extremity of the jaws. The length of time
  which this Whale can endure immersion has been variously stated. The
  utmost limit of endurance is stated by Scammon to be one hour and twenty
  minutes. The pursuit of this Whale is attended by dangers, not in the
  least because the animal is itself fierce and ready to attack, but simply
  on account of the velocity with which, and the great depth to which, it
  will dive, and also to the huge muscular force which is exerted in its
  struggles to free itself from the harpoons. It is indeed an extremely
  timid beast. It has been remarked that "a bird alighting upon its back
  sometimes sets it off in great agitation and terror." Combined with this
  timidity of disposition is an intense affection for its young, "which
  would do honour," observed Scoresby, "to the superior intelligence of
  human beings." Yet that trader and observer goes on to remark that "the
  value of the prize ... cannot be sacrificed to feelings of compassion"!
  The fact that this Whale and its congener, <i>B. australis</i>, feed
  among swarms of minute pelagic creatures, which they engulf in their huge
  mouths, led the ancients to believe and assert that they fed upon water
  only. When the Whale feeds it moves along with some velocity, taking in
  huge mouthfuls of sea water with the contained organisms, which are then
  strained off by the whalebone and left stranded upon the tongue.</p>

  <p>Unlike its congener, the southern Right Whale, <i>B. australis</i>,<a
  name="NtA_232" href="#Nt_232"><sup>[232]</sup></a> is world-wide in
  distribution, avoiding only the Arctic regions. Where the Greenland Whale
  is found <i>B. australis</i> does not exist. The principal differences
  which it shows from <i>B. mysticetus</i> are firstly in the relatively
  shorter head and shorter and coarser whalebone. In the second place it
  has more ribs, fifteen pairs as against thirteen; but there is apparently
  some little confusion in the matter of ribs. An additional rib at the end
  of the series <!-- Page 360 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page360"></a>{360}</span>is apt to get lost, and in the skeleton of
  so huge and unmanageable a beast there is nothing more unwise than to
  insist upon, as specific characters, what may be due merely to defective
  preparation. This Whale has often, and the Greenland Whale also, a rough
  horny protuberance upon the snout known as the "bonnet." The causation of
  this is not clear. It has been spoken of as "a rudimentary frontal horn."
  But this suggestion of an Ungulate affinity can hardly be accepted. It
  seems to be more like a kind of corn.</p>

  <p>This Whale was once more abundant on the coasts of Europe than it is
  to-day; it was much hunted by the Basques in past time. The Whale which
  frequented the Bay of Biscay was usually called the Biscayan Whale or
  <i>B. biscayensis</i>; but there is probably no specific difference.
  Among the small towns which fringe the Bay, it is very common to find the
  Whale incorporated into the armorial bearings. "Over the portal of the
  first old house in the steep street of Guetaria," writes Sir Clements
  Markham,<a name="NtA_233" href="#Nt_233"><sup>[233]</sup></a> "there is a
  shield of arms consisting of Whales amid waves of the sea. At Motrico the
  town arms consist of a Whale in the sea harpooned, and with a boat with
  men holding the line." Plenty of other such examples testify to the
  prevalence of the whaling industry on these adjoining coasts of Spain and
  France. It appears that though the fishery began much earlier&mdash;even
  in the ninth century&mdash;the first actual document relating to it dates
  from the year 1150. It is in the shape of privileges granted by Sancho
  the Wise to the city of San Sebastian. The trade was still very
  flourishing in the sixteenth century. Rondeletius the naturalist
  described Bayonne as the centre of the trade, and tells us that the
  flesh, especially of the tongue, was exposed for sale as food in the
  markets.</p>

  <p>M. Fischer,<a name="NtA_234" href="#Nt_234"><sup>[234]</sup></a> who,
  as well as Sir Clements Markham, has given an important account of the
  whaling industry on the Basque shores, quotes an account of the methods
  pursued in the sixteenth century. It was at Biarritz&mdash;or as Ambroise
  Pare, from whom Fischer quotes, spelt it, Biaris&mdash;that the main
  fisheries were undertaken. The inhabitants set upon a hill a tower from
  which they could see "the Balaines which pass, and perceiving them coming
  partly by the loud noise they make, and <!-- Page 361 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page361"></a>{361}</span>partly by the water
  which they throw out by a conduit which they possess in the middle of the
  forehead." Several boats then set out in pursuit, some of which were
  reserved for men whose sole duty it was to pick out of the water their
  comrades who had overbalanced themselves in their excitement. The
  harpoons bore a mark by which their respective owners could recognise
  them, and the carcase of the animal was shared in accordance with the
  numbers and owners of the harpoons found sticking in the dead body of the
  Whale. At this period the fishery was at its height. But it continued to
  be an occupation along those shores until the beginning of the eighteenth
  century, after which it gradually declined. The fishery of Whales began
  to be carried farther afield than the shore, and for a long time the
  Basques furnished expert harpooners to whaling vessels proceeding to the
  Arctic seas. A curious example of the continuance of the fishery until at
  least 1712 is given by Sir C. Markham. In the parish records of Lequeito
  for that year, it is noted that a couple were married who possessed
  between them all the necessary outfit for a whaling cruise.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Neobalaena</i> is interesting from more than one point of
  view. Its size compared with its gigantic relatives is small, some 16 or
  17 feet. The genus bears the same kind of proportion to <i>Balaena</i>
  that <i>Kogia</i> does to <i>Physeter</i> among the Physeteridae. It is
  one of those Whales which are very restricted in habitat; up to the
  present it is only known from the Antarctic region in the neighbourhood
  of New Zealand and South Australia. Structurally it is in a few points
  intermediate between the Right Whales and the Rorquals. The head is
  proportionately (as well as, of course, actually) not so large as in
  <i>Balaena</i>. There is a falcate dorsal fin; but the head in outline is
  not Rorqual-like in spite of its similar proportions. The whalebone is
  long. The throat is not grooved. <i>Neobalaena</i> has forty-three
  vertebrae, of which the cervicals are all fused. There are as many as
  seventeen or eighteen dorsal vertebrae, the largest number in any
  Cetacean as far as is known. With these are articulated not eighteen but
  only seventeen ribs. The first dorsal vertebra appears to be without a
  rib. The ribs are very broad and flat. The body thus gets an appearance
  of a Sirenian. The lumbar vertebrae are fewer than in any other Cetacean,
  being only two. The scapula is more like that of the Rorquals than that
  of the Right Whales; <!-- Page 362 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page362"></a>{362}</span>that is to say, it is long and not very
  high. The skull is most like that of <i>Balaena</i>, but the process of
  the frontal arching over the eye is broader relatively than in
  <i>Balaena</i>, and thus approaches <i>Balaenoptera</i>. Nothing is known
  of the viscera of this Whale. The whalebone is white, and the animal was
  first described by Dr. Gray from pieces of "bone." It is not always that
  so fortunate a diagnosis of specific or generic difference has been made
  from a structure which apparently offers so little aid for
  discrimination.</p>

  <p>There is but a single species of the genus which is named
  <i>Neobalaena marginata</i>.<a name="NtA_235"
  href="#Nt_235"><sup>[235]</sup></a></p>

<h5><span class="sc">Sub-Order 2.</span> ODONTOCETI.</h5>

  <p>The <i>Odontoceti</i> have teeth but no whalebone; the blow-hole is
  single; the skull is not symmetrical; some of the ribs are
  two-headed.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Physeteridae.</b>&mdash;This family of the Odontocetes may
  be thus defined<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span>All or most of the
  cervical vertebrae are fused together. The costal cartilages are not
  ossified. In the skull the pterygoids are thick and meet in the middle
  line; the symphysis of the mandible is long. Teeth, more or fewer, are
  found in both jaws, but those of the mandible are alone functional (?
  exc. <i>Kogia</i>). The pectoral limb is smallish. The throat is grooved
  by two or four furrows.</p>

  <p>This family of Whales is again susceptible of division into the two
  sub-families&mdash;Physeterinae or Sperm Whales and the Ziphiinae or
  Beaked Whales. Professor P. J. van Beneden was strongly against any
  subdivision of what is here regarded as a perfectly natural family,
  embracing the Physeters and the Beaked Whales. There are, however, some
  reasons for the subdivision. The Ziphiinae have a reduced series of
  teeth, never exceeding two on each mandible, which contrasts with the
  fully-toothed mandibles of both <i>Physeter</i> and <i>Kogia</i>. The
  stomach of the Ziphioids is extraordinarily complicated even for a
  Cetacean. The small head of the latter group, which recalls in a curious
  way that of Mosasauroid reptiles and some Dinosaurs, is in contrast to
  the <!-- Page 363 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page363"></a>{363}</span>enormous head of the Cachalot and the very
  fairly-developed skull of the "Pygmy Sperm Whale." Both, however, furnish
  spermaceti, and in various osteological details come near together. On
  the whole we incline towards separating the Cachalots from the Ziphioids,
  and shall therefore commence with the former as being in some respects
  the more primitive members of the family Physeteridae.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 1. Physeterinae.</b>&mdash;This sub-family may be thus
  defined<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span>Teeth in lower jaw numerous. No
  distinct lachrymal bone. Stomach with only four compartments (? as to
  <i>Kogia</i>).</p>

  <p>Of this sub-family the best-known genus is <i>Physeter</i>, including
  the Sperm Whale or Cachalot. Of other reputed species we shall speak
  later. The genus is characterised in the first place by its large
  size&mdash;as much as 82 feet of length have been assigned to <i>Physeter
  macrocephalus</i>; but Sir William Flower thought that 55 or possibly 60
  feet might be a better approximation to the greatest length of the
  Cachalot. The head is enormous, a third of the length of the body, and
  terminates in a massive and bluntish snout. This is, however, not so
  abruptly truncated as is often represented in figures. According to
  Messrs. Pouchet and Chaves,<a name="NtA_236"
  href="#Nt_236"><sup>[236]</sup></a> it slopes forward two metres beyond
  the end of the lower jaw; the mouth is thus ventral and almost shark-like
  in position, as is the case also with the Pygmy Sperm Whale, to be
  considered later. In connexion with this peculiar position of the mouth,
  it has been asserted&mdash;Mr. F. T. Bullen figures it<a name="NtA_237"
  href="#Nt_237"><sup>[237]</sup></a>&mdash;that the Sperm Whale turns over
  upon its back to bite. The blow-hole is single, and shaped like the
  sound-hole of a violin; it lies upon one side, and is not median in
  position. The throat is grooved as in the Ziphioids by two grooves. The
  dorsal fin is represented by a whole series of lowish humps, decreasing
  in elevation from before backwards. The pectoral fins are not large
  relatively speaking. The great square head is not occupied entirely by
  the skull; the cavity lying above, which is of course traversed by the
  tube ending in the blow-hole, is filled with the spermaceti, which is
  fluid fat during the life of the animal. Spermaceti also occurs in other
  Whales; and that of <i>Hyperoodon</i>, whence it has been extracted for
  commercial purposes, is said to offer no differences of importance from
  the spermaceti of the <!-- Page 364 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page364"></a>{364}</span>Sperm Whale. Spermaceti as a drug appears
  to have been first mentioned in the pharmacopoeias of the famous medical
  school of Salerno towards the year 1100. But it was confounded with a
  totally distinct substance, viz. ambergris. The confusion was also made
  by the famous alchemist Albertus Magnus, and by the observant Archbishop
  of Upsala, Olaus Magnus, in his work <i>De gentibus
  septentrionalibus</i>. It was supposed in fact by these writers to be the
  liberated sperm of the Whale, hence obviously the name. Later on, the
  substance in question was regarded as the brain of the Cachalot, in fact
  as late as the middle of the eighteenth century. It was Hunter and Camper
  who really discovered the true nature of the substance, oil of course, in
  the cavities of the skull.<a name="NtA_238"
  href="#Nt_238"><sup>[238]</sup></a> The huge skull of <i>Physeter</i> "is
  perhaps the most modified from the ordinary type" of skull in the whole
  mammalian class.</p>

  <p>The top of the skull rises into a huge crest lying transversely, and
  from it slope forward two lateral crests formed from the maxillary bones;
  in this great basin lies the spermaceti already referred to. The skull,
  as in Toothed Whales generally, is exceedingly asymmetrical. The right
  premaxillary and the left nasal bones are much larger than their fellows;
  indeed the right nasal is hardly present as a separate bone. The parietal
  if present is fused with the supra-occipital. The jugal is large, and is
  not divided into two pieces as it is in the Ziphioids. The pterygoids
  meet below for a considerable distance, as in many Dolphins, and in the
  Edentata among other mammals. The symphysis of the lower jaw is very
  long, but the bones do not appear to be ankylosed. The length of the
  symphysis recalls that of the Gangetic Dolphin, <i>Platanista</i>.</p>

  <p>In the vertebral column the atlas alone is free, the remaining
  cervicals being fused. There are only eleven dorsal vertebrae, eight
  lumbars, and twenty-four caudals. The breastbone of this Whale is a
  roughly-triangular bone made up of three pieces. Four cartilaginous
  sternal ribs are attached to this bone. The scapula is remarkable for the
  fact that it is concave on the outer and convex on the inner surface;
  otherwise it is quite typically Cetacean in form. The shortness of the
  pectoral limb is shown by the phalangeal formula, which is as
  follows<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span>I&nbsp;1, II&nbsp;5, III&nbsp;5, IV&nbsp;4, V&nbsp;3. <!--
  Page 365 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page365"></a>{365}</span></p>

  <p>One of the reasons for the pursuit of the Sperm Whale is the desire to
  obtain that extremely valuable product ambergris. This substance has long
  been known; but its true nature was for centuries in dispute. In Dr.
  Johnson's <i>Dictionary</i> (so recently as the edition of 1818!)
  ambergris is provided with alternative definitions; it is either the
  excrement of birds washed off rocks, or honeycombs that have fallen into
  the sea!</p>

  <p>An old writer asserted of ambergris that it was "not the scum or
  excrement of the whale, but issues out of the root of a tree, which tree,
  howsoever it stands on the land, alwaies shoots forth its roots towards
  the sea, seaking the warmth of it, thereby to deliver the fattest gum
  that coms out of it, which tree otherwise by its copious fatness might be
  burnt and destroyed." These "explanations" were caused by the fact that
  ambergris is sometimes found floating in the sea. Ambergris is, of
  course, a product of the intestinal canal of the Sperm Whale; it seems to
  be of the nature of cholesterin, and its place of origin was conclusively
  proved by finding the beaks of cuttle-fish imbedded in it. When first
  extracted from the alimentary canal it is of greasy feel and consistency;
  later it hardens, and acquires its characteristic sweet earthy odour.
  Ambergris is used mainly as a vehicle for scents, and is a costly
  substance. A piece weighing 130 lbs. was valued at £500. Though now
  entirely used in connexion with perfumery, it was held by the ancients to
  be of great value as a specific in certain diseases.</p>

  <p>The Sperm Whale is chiefly a tropical animal. Examples that have been
  cast up on our shores are strayed individuals. It often goes about in
  herds, which seem to be composed of females. Its food is chiefly
  cuttle-fishes, and it is said to have a predilection for those colossal
  cuttle-fishes whose existence has until recently been doubted. Mr. Bullen
  has sketched a conflict between these two giants of the deep. On the
  other hand it is said that its large throat, more than big enough to
  swallow a man (the Whale is credited with being that which swallowed
  Jonah), does not usually admit fishes larger than Bonitos and
  Albacores.</p>

  <p>The ferocity of the Cachalot has been denied and affirmed. It
  certainly has great strength, for it can throw itself completely out of
  the water. Captain Scammon thinks that ships which are mysteriously lost
  at sea, with no obviously assignable cause, are sometimes the victims of
  the furious rushes of a bull <!-- Page 366 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page366"></a>{366}</span>Sperm Whale. Marco Polo took much the same
  view, but suggested that the Whale did not deliberately attack the ship,
  but was deceived by the foam following in its wake into thinking "there
  is something to eat afloat, and makes a rush forward, whereby it shall
  often stave in some part of the ship."<a name="NtA_239"
  href="#Nt_239"><sup>[239]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Sir W. Flower and many others are of opinion that there is but one
  species of Cachalot. But many names have been given to supposed other
  forms. The genus itself has even been divided, and to a set of vertebrae
  from the south Dr. Gray gave the perfectly superfluous name of
  <i>Meganeuron kreffti</i>. The "High-finned Cachalot" rests mainly upon
  the suggestions of Sir Robert Sibbald. It is supposed to have a high
  dorsal fin, and teeth in the upper as well as in the lower jaw. Common
  though it was asserted by its describer to be, there is not a bone, not a
  fragment even of a bone, alleged to belong to <i>Physeter tursio</i> in
  any museum in the world! It seems premature, therefore, to include this
  mysterious creature in any list of Cetacea, though that was done by no
  less a naturalist than the late Mr. Thomas Bell. It is this creature
  round which most of the stories of ferocity congregate. It is held to be
  the monster from which Perseus delivered Andromeda, and which was about
  to devour Angelica upon the shore of Brittany. The fact of the matter is,
  that the Sperm Whale, like so very many other Whales, is world-wide in
  range; and those naturalists who did not believe in so wide a
  distribution found themselves obliged, in order to satisfy their own
  views, to create new species for those of distant localities. Hence the
  dozen or so of synonyms which refer to what is to be called <i>Physeter
  macrocephalus</i>.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Kogia</i> (sometimes written <i>Cogia</i>), the so-called
  "Pygmy Sperm Whale," is a southern form of much smaller dimensions than
  its gigantic ally just described. <i>Kogia</i> does not exceed 15 feet or
  so in length. It differs from <i>Physeter</i> also in the well-marked and
  falcate dorsal fin, in its generally delphinoid form, in the short snout,
  and the more normal (for a Whale) shape of the blow-hole, which is
  crescentic.</p>

  <p>There are also a number of osteological characters in which the two
  Physeterines differ from each other. In <i>Kogia</i> all the cervical
  vertebrae are ankylosed together; the skull is short, though equally
  asymmetrical; the ribs are as many as twelve or <!-- Page 367 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page367"></a>{367}</span>fourteen; the scapula
  has not the concave face that it has in <i>Physeter</i>. The functional
  teeth of the lower jaw seem to be reinforced by two on each side of the
  upper jaw. Moreover, the articulation of the ribs with the vertebrae does
  not show the very anomalous state of affairs that characterises
  <i>Physeter</i>, where the two heads of a rib may be upon one
  vertebra.</p>

  <p>While there is no doubt as to the generic distinctness of
  <i>Kogia</i>, there is again the same difficulty that is met with
  throughout the whole of the order in settling into how many species the
  genus requires dividing.</p>

  <p>We can dismiss, as unnecessary, additional generic names
  (<i>Euphysetes</i>, <i>Callignathus</i>), but there do appear to be
  reasons for allowing two species, if the accounts of their osteology are
  to be depended upon. One of these is <i>K. breviceps</i>, with thirteen
  pairs of ribs, no teeth in the upper jaw, fourteen or fifteen on each
  side of the lower jaw, vertebral formula C&nbsp;7, D&nbsp;13, L&nbsp;9, Ca&nbsp;25, and
  phalangeal formula I&nbsp;2, II&nbsp;8, III&nbsp;8, IV&nbsp;8, V&nbsp;7.</p>

  <p>The other will then be <i>K. simus</i>, with fourteen pairs of ribs,
  two teeth in the upper jaw, nine in each ramus of the lower jaw,
  vertebral formula C&nbsp;7, D&nbsp;14, L&nbsp;5, Ca&nbsp;24, and phalangeal formula I&nbsp;2,
  II&nbsp;5, III&nbsp;4, IV&nbsp;4, V&nbsp;2.</p>

  <p>A Californian species has been called <i>K. floweri</i>, whose teeth
  seem to be particularly long and recurved. And the New Zealand <i>K.
  pottsi</i> has been held to be also a distinct form. There seems to be
  nothing of special interest to record about the way of life of these
  Cetaceans, which are but imperfectly known.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 2. Ziphiinae.</b>&mdash;Teeth in the lower jaw not more
  than two on each side. A distinct lachrymal bone. Stomach with very
  numerous compartments.</p>

  <p>These Whales are all of moderate size, not exceeding 30 feet or so in
  length. They have a falcate dorsal fin rather near the end of the body;
  the muzzle is prolonged, hence the name often given to them of "Beaked
  Whales." The throat is grooved; the blow-hole is single and median,
  crescentic in form, with the concavity pointing forwards. A character
  possibly differentiating the Ziphioids from other Whales is the fact that
  the body ends in a rounded projection between the flukes of the tail.
  This has at any rate been noted in <i>Mesoplodon</i>, <i>Ziphius</i>, and
  <i>Hyperoodon</i>. The Ziphioid Whales are by no means common; indeed of
  <i>Berardius</i> but four or five specimens have ever been <!-- Page 368
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page368"></a>{368}</span>met with. Most
  of them are southern in range, and the vast stretches of desolate coast
  which occur in these regions of the world account possibly for the rarity
  of their remains. These Whales have done duty more than once for the "Sea
  Serpent." Quite recently an alleged sea serpent turned out to be a couple
  of <i>Mesoplodon</i> lying head to tail! The head in these Whales is
  small compared to the body. The skull is characterised by the strong
  maxillary crests, enormously developed in the male <i>Hyperoodon</i>. The
  vertex of the skull too is raised, forming a pronounced prominence behind
  the aperture of the nares (blow-hole); in many forms the rostrum is made
  of very dense bone, and is thus relatively abundant in rock strata. The
  pterygoids meet in the middle line as in the Cachalot. In addition to the
  few functional teeth in the lower jaw there are more numerous but small
  teeth in the upper jaw. These are not always to be recognised, as they
  are not attached to the bone, but merely imbedded in the gums, so that
  they come away when the skull is prepared.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Berardius</i><a name="NtA_240"
  href="#Nt_240"><sup>[240]</sup></a> differs from <i>Mesoplodon</i> by its
  rather more symmetrical skull, of which the vertex is formed by the
  nasals. The mesethmoid is only partly ossified. The teeth are two on each
  side of the mandible, with their apices directed forwards. The vertebral
  formula is C&nbsp;7, D&nbsp;10, L&nbsp;12, Ca&nbsp;19.</p>

  <p><i>B. arnouxi</i>, from the seas of New Zealand, is the only species
  of this genus which is well known. It is 30 or 32 feet in length, and is
  of a velvety black colour, with a greyish belly. Instead of lowing like a
  cow, this Whale has been described as "bellowing like a bull"! A singular
  and somewhat inexplicable fact has been stated of this species. The teeth
  were said to be protrusible, and Sir James Hector stated that the teeth
  were imbedded "in a tough cartilaginous sac which adheres loosely in the
  socket of the jaw, and is moved by a series of muscular bundles that
  elevate or depress it." Sir William Flower justly observed that these
  statements "accord so little with anything hitherto known in mammalian
  anatomy that further observations on the subject are extremely
  desirable." Like other Ziphioids, <i>Berardius</i> feeds mainly, if not
  entirely, upon cuttle-fish, a prey eminently suited to their almost
  toothless mouths. It is not known whether <i>Berardius</i> has the <!--
  Page 369 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page369"></a>{369}</span>Ziphioid grooves upon the throat. Nothing
  is known of the structure of the internal viscera of this Whale. It
  appears not to be really limited to the region of New Zealand, as is
  often stated, for Malm has lately described a skull (<i>Berardius
  vegae</i>) from Bering's Straits.<a name="NtA_241"
  href="#Nt_241"><sup>[241]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Mesoplodon</i><a name="NtA_242" href="#Nt_242"><sup>[242]</sup></a>
  is a world-wide genus embracing a number of species; on the lowest
  estimate seven species can be distinguished, and Sir W. Flower would add
  two more. These are moderate-sized Whales, 15 to 17 feet in length. In
  the skull the mesethmoid is ossified; the nasals are sunk between the
  upper ends of the premaxillae. There are but a single pair of teeth in
  the mandible attached to nearly the middle of its length (whence the
  generic name). The vertebral formula is C&nbsp;7, D&nbsp;9 or 10, L&nbsp;10 or 11, Ca&nbsp;19
  or 20. The sternum consists of four or five pieces. The amount to which
  the cervical vertebrae are fused varies; but some are always fused.</p>

  <p>The only species which has ever been stranded on the shores of this
  country is <i>M. bidens</i>, an example of which was described many years
  ago as the "Toothless Whale of Havre"; it was an old animal which had
  probably lost its teeth. Nevertheless it received the separate generic
  and specific name of <i>Aodon dalei</i>. The animal lived for two days
  out of the water, and made a sound like the "lowing of a cow." An
  instance of the rarity of the Whales of this genus is afforded by <i>M.
  europaeus</i>, of which only a single skull is known; this was extracted
  from a dead body, found floating, about the year 1840. It has never
  appeared since. <i>M. layardi</i> is remarkable on account of the very
  large size of its strap-shaped teeth; these curve over the upper jaw in
  such a way as to prevent the animal from fully opening its jaws. The case
  is curiously paralleled by the Sabre-toothed Tiger. This species is
  antarctic in range. From the opposite extremity of the globe comes <i>M.
  stejnegeri</i>, again known by but a single skull. It is singular on
  account of the large size of the brain case, and is a native of Bering's
  Straits. <i>M. hectori</i> has its two teeth situated quite at the
  extremity of the mandible, and in this feature approximates to the genus
  <i>Berardius</i>. It was, indeed, confounded with that genus by one
  naturalist. <!-- Page 370 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page370"></a>{370}</span></p>

  <p><i>Ziphius</i> is a genus which is also of world-wide range. Here
  again the number of species is at present merely a matter of opinion. The
  prevalent impression, however, is that but a single species exists, which
  will therefore have the name of <i>Z. cavirostris</i>. The genus (and for
  the matter of that the species too) may be thus characterised in
  comparison with its allies. The mesethmoid is ossified as in
  <i>Mesoplodon</i>, but the nasals joined together form the vertex of the
  skull. There are two teeth near the symphysis of the mandible, besides
  the usual small and "functionless" teeth in the upper jaw. The vertebral
  formula is C&nbsp;7, D&nbsp;9 or 10, L&nbsp;11, Ca&nbsp;21.</p>

  <p>The throat of a <i>Ziphius</i> from New Zealand was described by
  Messrs. Scott and Parker<a name="NtA_243"
  href="#Nt_243"><sup>[243]</sup></a> as having three grooves on each side.
  Whether this form is the same as von Haast's <i>Z. novae zelandiae</i> is
  a matter of doubt; but the individual to which his name has been applied
  was 26 feet long, and had but a single groove on each side. Even in the
  external characters of many Whales many points require clearing up. Our
  knowledge of <i>Ziphius</i> dates from the year 1804, when a skull
  "completely petrified in appearance" was picked up upon the Mediterranean
  coast of France, and described by the great Cuvier. It was forty years
  before another specimen was found. In the New Zealand specimen of von
  Haast already referred to, the body was scored by numerous lacerations.
  These wounds may have been due to fights among the Whales themselves; the
  forwardly-situated teeth would be capable of inflicting such wounds. But
  it has also been stated that the armed suckers of gigantic cuttle-fish
  are responsible for these scratches.</p>

  <p><i>Hyperoodon</i> is the most easily-distinguishable genus of Ziphioid
  Whales. Its characters are the following<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span>The skull has enormously-developed maxillary
  crests in the adult male; the mesethmoid is not fully ossified. There is
  but a single tooth to each ramus of the lower jaw, besides, of course,
  the usual small teeth in the upper jaw. The vertebral formula is C&nbsp;7,
  D&nbsp;9, L&nbsp;9, Ca&nbsp;18. The cervicals are fused into one mass, more or fewer
  being free in other Ziphioids. The sternum consists of three pieces only,
  the last of which is bifid posteriorly.</p>

  <p>The name <i>Hyperoodon</i> was given to this Whale by Colonel Lacepède
  on account of the rough papillae upon the palate, which <!-- Page 371
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page371"></a>{371}</span>were mistaken
  by that observer for teeth. It is curious that the name is really
  appropriate in spite of this mistake, though of course it would be so to
  all the Ziphioids. In more than one feature this genus comes nearest of
  all the Ziphiinae to <i>Physeter</i>. Its enormous maxillary crests are
  paralleled in that Whale; but in <i>Hyperoodon</i> their great thickness
  contrasts with the thinness of those of the Cachalot. The correspondence
  in the attachment of a rib to its vertebra by both heads is noteworthy.
  It is remarkable that in this particular <i>Hyperoodon</i> is more like
  <i>Physeter</i> than the supposed nearest ally of the
  latter&mdash;<i>Kogia</i>.</p>

  <p>Of this genus two species are known. The best known is the common
  northern <i>H. rostratum</i> (with many aliases); the second species from
  the southern hemisphere, <i>H. planifrons</i>, is only known from a
  single water- and pebble-worn skull. Its identification, however, depends
  upon the known accuracy of the late Sir William Flower.</p>

  <p>The northern species (<i>Hyperoodon rostratum</i>) has often been
  recorded upon our own coasts; the first record of the stranding of this
  Whale was in the year 1717. In that year an example was found at Maldon,
  in Essex. Like the Beluga, <i>Hyperoodon rostratum</i> gets lighter in
  colour with advancing years. The young are black; the old animals pale
  brown with some white about them. The under surface, however, is always
  greyish white. The length of this Whale reaches to at any rate 30 feet.
  But John Hunter had a specimen which he believed to be 40 feet in length.
  The specimen, however, consisted only of a skull, so that error might
  have crept in. It has already been mentioned that the old males have
  enormous maxillary crests. According to M. Bouvier, who has lately made
  an exhaustive examination of the anatomy of this Whale,<a name="NtA_244"
  href="#Nt_244"><sup>[244]</sup></a> the females occasionally exhibit the
  same crests, which are thus presumably of the nature of spurs sometimes
  seen in old females among the Gallinaceous birds. The number of grooves
  upon the throat is in dispute in this Whale as in <i>Ziphius</i>. One
  pair is the usual allowance; but Kükenthal found four in some embryos
  studied by him. Attention has already been called to the voice of
  Ziphioid Whales. <i>Hyperoodon</i> neither "lows" nor "bellows," but
  "sobs"! <i>Hyperoodon rostratum</i> is a gregarious Whale, going about in
  herds, or "gams" as they should technically be termed, of four to ten or
  even fifteen. This Whale <!-- Page 372 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page372"></a>{372}</span>can leap right out of the water, and while
  in the air can turn its head from side to side, a capability which has
  not been mentioned in any other Whale. It can also stay under water for
  an unusually long period. Captain Gray,<a name="NtA_245"
  href="#Nt_245"><sup>[245]</sup></a> who has made an accurate study of
  this species, states that so long a period as two hours is the limit of
  endurance; this event occurred in the case of a harpooned Whale.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Delphinidae.</b>&mdash;This family, which includes the
  greater number of Cetacea, may thus be characterised<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span>Whales of small to moderate size. Teeth as a
  rule numerous, and present in the upper as well as in the lower jaw.
  Maxillae without large crests; the pterygoids, often meeting in the
  middle line, enclose an air space open behind. The anterior (five to
  eight) ribs are two headed, the posterior with tubercular head only. The
  sternal ribs are ossified.</p>

  <p>The Dolphins and Porpoises, as already stated, embrace the greater
  number of existing species of Whales. Sir W. Flower and others who have
  followed him, allow nineteen genera. But as to the exact number of known
  species there is much uncertainty. That very careful observer, Mr. True,
  considers<a name="NtA_246" href="#Nt_246"><sup>[246]</sup></a> that there
  are fifty which demand recognition. As many as one hundred have received
  names. The matter is one which is perhaps barely ripe for decision. All
  the Dolphin tribe are, for Whales, smallish animals. The Killer Whale,
  <i>Orca</i>, is the only genus (or species?) which usually attains to
  more than moderate bulk. The rather mysterious <i>Delphinus
  coronatus</i>, 36 feet in length, of M. de Fréminville, would seem to be
  a Ziphioid; it was described as having a very pointed beak, and as having
  the dorsal fin situated near the tail; such characters suggest a
  <i>Mesoplodon</i>.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Delphinapterus</i>, the Beluga or White Whale, consists
  of but a single species, though as usual more than one name has been
  given to supposed different species. It is characterised as a genus by
  the following assemblage of structural features<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span>It has only eight to ten teeth occupying the
  anterior part of the jaws only. All the cervical vertebrae are free and
  unjoined. The vertebral formula is C&nbsp;7, D&nbsp;11 (or 12), L&nbsp;9, Ca&nbsp;23. The
  pterygoids are wide apart, though they converge as if about to meet at
  their posterior ends. There is no dorsal fin. The colour is white. <!--
  Page 373 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page373"></a>{373}</span></p>

  <p>The Beluga is a northern species purely. The reputed form, <i>D.
  kingii</i>, was said to come from Australian seas; but there seems to
  have been an error in this statement. It is interesting to note that the
  white colour, so characteristic of the genus and species, is not found in
  the young, which are blackish. They gradually pale as they advance
  towards maturity. <i>Delphinapterus leucas</i> reaches a length of 10
  feet, and like other Porpoises will ascend rivers in search of food. It
  is said to be specially addicted to salmon. Among the contents of the
  stomach have been found quantities of sand. But this habit of swallowing
  sand or pebbles has been noted in other Whales. Whether it is or is not
  accidental (taken in with ground-living food), it seems hardly likely
  that it is used for purposes of ballast! The Beluga has a voice; but the
  name "Sea Canary" is hardly suitable to it. A specimen of this species,
  recently described from the shores of Scotland (it is often thrown up
  upon our coasts), which had got entangled in the stakes of a new net, was
  regarded by the natives, on account of its white colour, as a ghost.
  Externally, besides its colour, the Beluga is remarkable for possessing a
  distinct neck, which is correlated of course with the freedom of the
  cervical vertebrae, and is also seen in Platanistidae.</p>

  <p>The Narwhal (<i>Monodon</i>) is closely allied in structure to the
  last genus. It has the following anatomical characters<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span>The teeth are reduced to a single "horn" in the
  upper jaw, which is rudimentary in the female. The neck vertebrae are
  free. The vertebral formula is C&nbsp;7, D&nbsp;11, L&nbsp;6, Ca&nbsp;26. The pterygoids are
  as in <i>Delphinapterus</i>, and, as in that genus, there are no hairs
  upon the face or dorsal fin.</p>

  <p>This genus is of course most obviously characterised by the twisted
  tusk of the male, which is occasionally double. This tusk has given to
  the only species of the genus, <i>M. monoceros</i>, both its generic and
  specific name. The animal has a spotted colour; but, as in the case of
  the Beluga, old animals tend to become white. The use of its horn to
  <i>Monodon</i> has been debated. In the first place it is clearly a
  secondary sexual character. The males have been observed to cross their
  horns like rapiers in a fencing match. It may be that they are used in
  more serious combats. An ingenious suggestion is that the long and strong
  tusk enables its possessor to break the thick ice and <!-- Page 374
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page374"></a>{374}</span>make a
  breathing hole. A third suggestion is due to Scoresby, who was led to
  make it from having taken out of the stomach of a Narwhal a large skate.
  He held that with its tusk the Whale empaled the fish and then swallowed
  it. The Narwhal is not large, 15 feet or so in length. But Lacepède, who
  was apt to compile with lack of discrimination, speaks of 60 feet long
  Narwhals. <i>Monodon</i> is purely Arctic, and but three or four
  specimens have ever been cast up on our shores.</p>

  <p>Of true Porpoises, genus <i>Phocaena</i>, there are apparently several
  species. The genus itself has the following characters<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span>The teeth are sixteen to twenty-six on each
  half of each jaw; their crowns are compressed and lobed. The pterygoids
  do not meet. The dorsal fin has a row of tubercles along its margin.</p>

  <p>The Porpoise of our coasts, <i>P. communis</i>, is a smallish species
  6 to 8 feet in length. There are two to four hairs present in the young;
  its colour is black, generally lighter on the belly. The first six
  cervical vertebrae are fused. The ribs vary in number from twelve to
  fourteen pairs. It is a gregarious Whale, and will ascend rivers; it has
  been seen for example in the Seine at Paris. The name Porpoise is often
  written Porkpisce, which of course shows its origin. Very conveniently it
  was regarded as a fish, and therefore allowed to be eaten in Lent. The
  celebrated Dr. Caius, a gourmet as well as a physician and the refounder
  of a college, invented a particular sauce wherewith to dress this royal
  dish. Some time since Dr. Gray described a Porpoise from Margate as a
  distinct species (see p. <a href="#page342">342</a>) on account of the
  tubercles, which are now known to be a generic character.</p>

  <p>Dr. Burmeister's <i>P. spinipennis</i> seems, however, to be really
  distinct. It was captured near the mouth of the Rio de la Plata. It is
  more tuberculated on the fin and back, and has fewer teeth (sixteen as
  against twenty-six).</p>

  <p>Mr. True's <i>P. dallii</i> of the Pacific (where the Common Porpoise
  also occurs) is characterised chiefly by its very long vertebral column,
  consisting of ninety-eight vertebrae; there are only sixty-eight in the
  other species. The Eastern genus <i>Neomeris</i> is placed with
  <i>Phocaena</i> by Dr. Blanford. It practically only differs by the
  absence of a dorsal fin. It is only about 4 feet long, and inhabits the
  seas of India, Cape of Good Hope, and Japan. The one species is called
  <i>N. phocaenoides</i>.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Globicephalus</i> is to be defined thus<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span>Teeth <!-- Page 375 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page375"></a>{375}</span>seven to twelve on each side, confined to
  anterior end of jaws. Skull raised into a prominence behind the
  blow-hole; pterygoids large and in contact. Pectoral fin long and
  falcate; dorsal fin present. No beak. Vertebral formula C&nbsp;7, D&nbsp;11, L&nbsp;11
  to 14, Ca&nbsp;27 to 29. Six pairs of the ribs are two-headed.</p>

  <p>The best known species of the genus is the Ca'ing Whale, <i>G.
  melas</i>.<a name="NtA_247" href="#Nt_247"><sup>[247]</sup></a> This
  animal reaches a length of 20 feet, and is thus one of the largest of the
  Delphinidae. It is gregarious and was, even is now, much hunted in the
  Faeroe Islands. Its sheep-like habits (embodied in one scientific name
  <i>deductor</i>) enable it to be easily driven on shore in herds, which
  are then harpooned. The foetus of this Whale has a few hairs; the number
  of phalanges in the two middle digits is very great, as many as eleven to
  fourteen. <i>G. scammoni</i>, <i>G. brachypterus</i>, and <i>G.
  indicus</i> are other reputed species of the genus allowed by True and
  Blanford.</p>

  <p><i>Grampus</i> is a genus allied to the last. It has no teeth in the
  upper jaw, and but three to seven in the lower jaw, near the symphysis of
  the mandible. The pterygoids are in contact. There is no beak, and the
  pectoral fin is long. There are twelve pairs of ribs, of which six are
  two-headed. Apparently there is but one species, <i>G. griseus</i>, known
  as "Risso's Dolphin." It is a Mediterranean and Atlantic form, and is not
  common.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Orca</i> has as characters<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span>Teeth ten to thirteen, long and strong.
  Pterygoids not quite meeting. Vertebrae C&nbsp;7, D&nbsp;11 to 12, L&nbsp;10, Ca&nbsp;23. The
  first two or three fused. The dorsal fin is long and pointed.</p>

  <p>Of this genus there may be more than one species; but the best known
  is the Killer Whale, <i>O. gladiator</i> (Fig. 180, p. <a
  href="#page341">341</a>), often spoken of as the "Grampus."<a
  name="NtA_248" href="#Nt_248"><sup>[248]</sup></a> It is marked with
  contrasting bands of white or yellow upon a black body-colour. The animal
  grows to a considerable length, as much as 30 feet. <i>Orca</i> is a
  powerful and rapacious Whale; and Eschricht has stated that from the
  stomach of one, thirteen Porpoises and fourteen Seals were extracted.
  They will also combine to attack larger Whales, and Scammon has related
  how he witnessed such an onslaught upon a Californian <!-- Page 376
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page376"></a>{376}</span>Grey Whale.
  "Belua truculenta dentibus," observed Olaus Magnus of this Cetacean. The
  high dorsal fin has been much exaggerated in old drawings; it has been
  even represented as strong and sharpened at the end, so as to be capable
  of ripping open the belly of a Whale. The fact that it sometimes lies
  over a little to one side is responsible for another anecdote: that an
  example of this Whale was seen to retire with a couple of Seals tucked
  away under the flippers, another grasped by the dorsal fin, and a fourth
  in the mouth! "When an Orca pursues a whale," wrote Dr. Frangius, "the
  latter makes a terrible bellowing like a bull when bitten by a dog." It
  is probable, according to F. Cuvier, that this Whale is the "Aries
  marinus" of the ancients, certain bands of white upon the head giving an
  impression of curved horns. It may also be the "horrible Sea-satyre" of
  Edmund Spencer.</p>

  <p>Allied to <i>Orca</i>, but distinguishable from it by some rather
  minute peculiarities, is <i>Pseudorca</i>. It may be thus defined<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span>Teeth eight to ten, much like those of
  <i>Orca</i>. Dorsal fin rather small, falcate. Vertebral formula C&nbsp;7,
  D&nbsp;10, L&nbsp;9, Ca&nbsp;24. Six or all the cervicals united. The curious fact about
  this Whale, which embraces only a single species, <i>P. crassidens</i>,
  is that it was first known in the fossil condition from remains
  discovered in the fens of Lincolnshire. An important day for cetologists
  was that on which a whole herd entered the Baltic and furnished material
  for a better study of this Whale. It is not, any more than its near ally
  <i>Orca</i>, confined to northern seas; for several examples, at first
  relegated to a distinct species (<i>P. meridionalis</i>), have been
  obtained from the seas round Tasmania.</p>

  <p><i>Orcella</i> (which has been written <i>Orcaella</i>) has fourteen
  to nineteen small sharp teeth in each half of each jaw. The pterygoids
  are widely separate. The dorsal fin is small and falcate. The vertebral
  formula is C&nbsp;7, D&nbsp;14, L&nbsp;14, Ca&nbsp;26. Seven ribs are two-headed, and five of
  them reach the sternum.</p>

  <p>This genus contains but a single species, <i>O. brevirostris</i>,
  which is both marine and fresh-water in habit; it occurs in the Indian
  seas, and in the Irrawaddy even as far up as 900 miles from the sea. Some
  regard the fresh-water individuals as a distinct form, <i>O.
  fluminalis</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Sagmatias</i> is a genus known only from a skull, which is
  remarkable for the elevation of the premaxillae into a crest; the <!--
  Page 377 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page377"></a>{377}</span>pterygoids are short, and there are
  thirty-two teeth in each half of each jaw.</p>

  <p><i>Feresia</i> is known from two skulls which are provided with ten to
  twelve teeth in each half of each jaw. It is intermediate between
  <i>Globicephalus</i>, <i>Grampus</i>, and <i>Lagenorhynchus</i>,
  according to Sir W. Flower.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Delphinus</i> contains the Dolphin, <i>D. delphis</i>.<a
  name="NtA_249" href="#Nt_249"><sup>[249]</sup></a> The genus may be
  characterised as follows<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span>Teeth small and
  numerous, forty-seven to sixty-five. Vertebral formula C&nbsp;7, D&nbsp;14 or 15,
  L&nbsp;21 or 22, Ca&nbsp;30 to 32. The atlas and axis are fused, the rest free. The
  palatal border of the maxillae is deeply grooved. The fins are falcate;
  the beak long and distinct.</p>

  <p>The Common Dolphin of the Mediterranean shows so many variations of
  colour, slight differences in the proportions of the bones of the skull,
  and in the number of the teeth, that it has been divided up into at least
  seventeen "species." But M. Fischer, who has studied many of these forms,
  does not admit them, and most students of this group of mammals follow
  him in the matter. The Dolphin is and has been the most familiar of
  Cetaceans; in consequence it has accumulated much anecdote of a mythical
  character. The extreme intelligence and goodwill towards man assigned to
  this creature by the ancients are possibly due to the anomaly of a
  creature ostensibly a fish showing many of the characters of higher
  animals. Its unfishlike intelligence baffled the early observers, who at
  once endowed it with especially advanced attributes. Hence the stories of
  Arion and others. The leaping of the Dolphin out of the water is
  exemplified in many Mediterranean coins and coats of arms; the heraldic
  dolphin is represented with an arched back as in leaping. The Dolphin
  reaches a length of some 7 feet, and appears to be world-wide in range.
  Possibly distinct is <i>D. longirostris</i>, characterised, as the name
  denotes, by the very long beak; it has also more teeth and is a native of
  Malabar. <i>D. roseiventris</i> again may be a third species of
  <i>Delphinus</i>. It comes from Torres Straits, and has the under parts
  rosy in colour.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Prodelphinus</i> has, like <i>Delphinus</i>, a distinct
  beak; but it has not the grooved maxillaries. No other character of
  importance appears to separate it from <i>Delphinus</i>. <!-- Page 378
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page378"></a>{378}</span></p>

  <p>The genus consists of some eight widely distributed species, which are
  none of them large Dolphins.</p>

  <p><i>Lagenorhynchus</i> has the following assemblage of characters<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span>Head with short, not very distinct beak. Dorsal
  and pectoral fins falcate. Teeth small, twenty-two to forty-five in each
  half jaw. Vertebrae ranging in number from seventy-three to ninety-two.
  Pterygoid bones either in contact or separate. There are fifteen or
  sixteen pairs of ribs, of which six are two-headed. Of this genus Mr.
  True allows eight species, which have been increased by a ninth since the
  publication of his "Revision."<a name="NtA_250"
  href="#Nt_250"><sup>[250]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Two species of <i>Lagenorhynchus</i> are known from our coasts; the
  rest are mainly southern in range. The British species are, firstly,
  <i>L. albirostris</i>, a Dolphin of some 9 feet in length. It has a large
  number of vertebrae, ninety-two in number. <i>L. albirostris</i> is a
  rare species, the first record of its occurrence on these shores being in
  1834. Since that date some eighteen individuals have been shot or
  stranded on the shores of the British Isles. The second British species,
  <i>L. acutus</i>, differs in colour from the first. As in the last, the
  upper parts are black and the under parts white; but in <i>L. acutus</i>
  there is also a stripe on the flanks, brownish in colour. It has fewer
  vertebrae, not more than eighty-two.</p>

  <p>The next genus of Dolphins, <i>Sotalia</i>, is characterised
  by&mdash;Teeth tolerably large, twenty-six to thirty-five. The vertebral
  formula is C&nbsp;7, D&nbsp;11 or 12, L&nbsp;10 to 14, Ca&nbsp;22. The pterygoids are not in
  contact in the middle line. It has a distinct beak.</p>

  <p>Of this genus there are some six species (the exact number, as in so
  many other genera, cannot be positively asserted), most of which are
  fluviatile or estuarine in habit. They are also on the whole
  characterised by their pale, if not actually white, coloration. <i>S.
  sinensis</i> of the Amoy is white with pinkish fins. <i>Sotalia
  guianensis</i> is American as its name denotes. It is figured by van
  Beneden as of a pale brown colour. It is very abundant in the Bay of Rio
  de Janeiro, and has the reputation of being a friend of man like some
  other Dolphins. The natives hold that it will bring to shore the bodies
  of drowned persons. The most singular species of the genus is that
  recently described by Professor Kükenthal as <i>S. teüszii</i>.<a
  name="NtA_251" href="#Nt_251"><sup>[251]</sup></a> This animal is purely
  fresh-water, being found in <!-- Page 379 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page379"></a>{379}</span>the Camaroon river, where it is extremely
  rare. The nostrils (blow-hole) are prolonged into a snout-like process, a
  fact which is of interest in connexion with the assertion that in
  <i>Balaenoptera</i> the blow-hole is puffed out during spouting. What is
  temporary in the Rorqual appears to be permanent in the <i>Sotalia</i>.
  More remarkable still, perhaps, is the assertion that it is a
  vegetable-feeding Dolphin. This is not a mere assertion except that it
  may not apply universally; for in the stomach of a specimen nothing but
  vegetable débris was found. But in the stomachs of other Whales (e.g.
  <i>Rhachianectes</i>) vegetable matter has also been found, which may
  perhaps have been taken in accidentally with the food.</p>

  <p><i>Steno</i> comes near <i>Sotalia</i>, and Dr. Blanford has
  transferred to it (under the one name of <i>Steno perniger</i>) the two
  species, <i>Sotalia gadamu</i> and <i>Sotalia lentiginosa</i>. It is,
  however, to be distinguished from <i>Sotalia</i> by the following
  characters<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span>Teeth large and few, twenty to
  twenty-seven on each side of each jaw, with furrowed surfaces to crowns.
  Vertebrae C&nbsp;7, D&nbsp;12 or 13, L&nbsp;15, Ca&nbsp;30 to 32. Pterygoids in contact.
  There are but two species apparently (not counting Dr. Blanford's).</p>

  <p><i>Tursiops</i> is not a very easily definable genus. These are its
  chief features<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span>Teeth large, twenty-two to
  twenty-six in number in each half of each jaw. Vertebral formula C&nbsp;7,
  D&nbsp;12 or 13, L&nbsp;16 or 17, Ca&nbsp;27. Pterygoids in contact. Beak distinct. Some
  five species are allowed; but it seems to be difficult to differentiate
  the others from <i>Tursiops tursio</i>. This, the best-known form, is
  quite or nearly world-wide in range, and occurs, though not abundantly,
  on our own coasts. Mr. True has observed that the eyelids of this Whale,
  which is largely hunted on the American coast, are as mobile as those of
  a terrestrial mammal. The name "tursio" is derived from Pliny. Belon
  would also derive from this word the French vernacular "marsouin." The
  latter term is sometimes regarded as a corruption of "Meerschwein," but
  it would seem to be more probably derivable from "marinum suem," from the
  Latin direct. <i>T. tursio</i> has the back black to lead-colour; the
  under parts white. In the reputed species, <i>T. abusalam</i>, from the
  Red Sea, the back is a dark sea-green. <i>T. tursio</i> reaches a length
  of 12 feet, but is more usually smaller.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Tursio</i> must be carefully distinguished from <!-- Page
  380 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page380"></a>{380}</span><i>Tursiops</i>. It has no dorsal fin, the
  teeth are small and numerous (forty-four), and the pterygoids are
  separate. There are two species, <i>T. borealis</i> and <i>T.
  peronii</i>, the former being northern and the latter more widely
  spread.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Cephalorhynchus</i> has for its chief characters the
  following<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span>Teeth twenty-five to thirty-one,
  small and sharp. Pterygoids widely separated. Dorsal fin not falcate, but
  triangular or ovate in form. Beak not well marked off from the head. The
  species of this genus are all southern in range; four are perhaps to be
  allowed.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Platanistidae.</b>&mdash;This family of Odontocetes may be
  distinguished from the Dolphins by the following assemblage of structural
  features<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span>Cervical vertebrae all free, and
  each one of some length (for a Cetacean). Jaws long and narrow, with a
  considerable length of symphysis. Teeth very numerous.</p>

  <p>This very meagre series of differential characters is largely due to
  <i>Pontoporia</i> on the Platanistid side, and to <i>Monodon</i> and
  <i>Delphinapterus</i> upon the Delphinid side. Otherwise the family
  Platanistidae would be extremely distinct. The two last-named genera have
  separate cervical vertebrae, and in the Beluga at any rate this is
  expressed externally by a quite distinct neck. Moreover, as Mr. True has
  pointed out, the pterygoid bones have not the involuted cavity below
  which characterises other Dolphins; and they have, what other Dolphins
  have not, an articulation outwards with the roofing bones of the skull.
  Sir W. Flower described the fact that in Inia (and the same occurs in
  Pontoporia) the palatines are separated from each other by the
  intervention of the vomer. In this feature they resemble certain
  Ziphioids, <i>Berardius</i>, <i>Oulodon</i> (= <i>Mesoplodon</i>)
  <i>grayi</i>, and <i>Hyperoodon</i>. The true Dolphins also appear to
  show the same intervention of the vomer in a few cases. There is nothing,
  therefore, distinctive from the Delphinidae in this feature.</p>

  <p>The existence of cartilaginous sternal ribs in <i>Inia</i> and
  <i>Platanista</i> shows affinity between these two genera and the
  Physeteridae. <i>Pontoporia</i> is Dolphin-like in this particular, as it
  is also in the mode of articulation of the ribs with the vertebral
  column. But this last matter has already been dealt with. The principal
  reason for placing <i>Pontoporia</i> with the other two genera is the
  close resemblance which its skull bears to that of <i>Inia</i>.</p>

  <p>The first genus of this family which will be noticed is
  <i>Platanista</i>. <!-- Page 381 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page381"></a>{381}</span>The following are its main characters<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span>Dorsal fin absent. Eyes rudimentary. Pectoral
  fins large and truncated at the extremity. Teeth, about twenty-nine in
  each half of each jaw. Scapula with the acromion coinciding with its
  anterior edge. Skull with enormous maxillary crests, and with the
  palatines entirely concealed by the pterygoids. The length of the above
  definition will serve to indicate how anomalous in many particulars is
  the structure of this "Dolphin."</p>

  <p>There is apparently but one species, <i>P. gangetica</i>, the "Susu."
  The Indian vernacular name is derived from the sound that the animal
  makes when spouting. It is an inhabitant of the Ganges and the Indus,
  together with their tributaries, and ascends very high up its streams. It
  is also thought to be purely fluviatile and never to desert the rivers
  for the sea. <i>Platanista</i> lives chiefly by grubbing in the mud for
  prawns and fish. Grains of rice have also been found in the stomach, but
  this would seem to be accidental. The long snout of the Susu has been
  compared to the long snout of the Gharial, a native of the same region.
  This Whale grows to a length of over 9 feet, but this length is
  exceptional. Its anatomy has been elaborately described by Dr.
  Anderson.<a name="NtA_252" href="#Nt_252"><sup>[252]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The next genus, <i>Inia</i>, is thus to be characterised<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span>Dorsal fin rudimentary; pectorals large and
  ovate. Teeth, as many as thirty-two on each side, often with an
  additional tubercle. Skull without large maxillary crests; palatines not
  hidden by pterygoids, but divided by vomer. The vertebrae of this genus
  are few in number, only forty-one in all, which are thus distributed:
  C&nbsp;7, D&nbsp;13, L&nbsp;3, Ca&nbsp;18. The peculiarities of the vertebral column are
  several. In the first place, as has been mentioned in the definition of
  the family, all the cervicals are separate and individually of some
  length. Secondly, the axis has a better trace of an odontoid process than
  in any other Whale except <i>Platanista</i>, where it is even more
  obvious. The lumbar region is remarkable on account of its restriction to
  three vertebrae. The sternum, by what we must regard as convergence, is
  somewhat like that of the Whalebone whales. It consists of one piece
  only, of a roughly-oval form, to which apparently only two pairs of
  (cartilaginous) sternal ribs are attached. In the fore-limb the
  proportions between the humerus and the radius are more like <!-- Page
  382 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page382"></a>{382}</span>those of
  terrestrial mammals; <i>i.e.</i> the humerus is distinctly the longer,
  the converse usually obtaining among Whales. But <i>Platanista</i> again
  agrees with <i>Inia</i>. The teeth are remarkable for the fact that the
  hindermost ones of the series have an additional lobe; they are not
  purely conical as are those of Whales generally.</p>

  <p>There is but one species, <i>Inia geoffrensis</i>, which inhabits the
  Amazons, and grows to a length of 8 feet. Its colour variations are
  rather extraordinary, unless they can be set down to sex, which has been
  denied. Some individuals are wholly pink; others are black above and pink
  beneath. This Whale is believed by the Indians to attack a man in the
  water, and it is added that the <i>Sotalia</i> of the same streams will
  defend him from these attacks! Naturally, therefore, superstitious
  reverence attaches to this Dolphin, which is tiresome to the naturalist
  who wants specimens, as Professor Louis Agassiz found.</p>

  <p>In the genus <i>Pontoporia</i><a name="NtA_253"
  href="#Nt_253"><sup>[253]</sup></a> the dorsal fin is well developed and
  falcate. The teeth are very numerous, 200 in all. The ribs articulate as
  in Dolphins. The skull closely resembles that of Inia, and the scapula
  is, as in that genus, "normal."</p>

  <p>The proper name for <i>Pontoporia</i> is really <i>Stenodelphis</i>,
  which name was first used by Gervais a month or two before Gray, who
  separated it from the vague <i>Delphinus</i> of its original discoverer,
  Gervais himself. It has a longer snout than <i>Inia</i>, which, being
  bent towards the extremity in a downward direction, curiously suggests
  the skull of a Curlew. In details, however, the skull is exceedingly like
  that of <i>Inia</i>. It is nearly symmetrical. The vertebral formula
  appears to be the following<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span>C&nbsp;7, D&nbsp;10,
  L&nbsp;5, Ca&nbsp;20 = 42, just one over the number of the vertebrae in
  <i>Inia</i>. The sternum is in two pieces. Of the ten pairs of ribs the
  first three are double-headed. These and the next have sternal moieties
  joining the sternum, of which the first three are ossified, the last
  being apparently merely a ligament.</p>

  <p>There is a single species of the genus, <i>P. blainvillii</i>. This
  Whale is described by Mr. Lydekker as being of a clear brown colour,
  harmonising with the waters of the estuary of the Amazons and the La
  Plata which it inhabits. The same colour characterises <i>Sotalia
  pallida</i> of those parts of the world, and <!-- Page 383 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page383"></a>{383}</span>may be a colour
  adaptation. But the extant accounts of the colour of this Dolphin
  vary&mdash;quite possibly in accordance with real variations, such as are
  exhibited by <i>Inia</i> already spoken of. <i>Pontoporia blainvillii</i>
  is a smallish Dolphin some 4 feet in length.</p>

  <p><b>Fossil Odontocetes.</b>&mdash;Several of the existing genera of
  Dolphins are also known in a fossil condition, as well as Ziphioid Whales
  closely related to existing forms. We shall deal here only with a few
  genera of fossil Odontocetes which depart in their structure from
  existing forms.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Physodon</i> is Miocene, and has been found in Patagonia.
  It appears to be most nearly allied to the Physeteridae, but should
  probably form a distinct family. <i>Physodon</i> was not so large as
  <i>Physeter</i>, the skull measuring only some 10 feet. It thus comes
  nearer in point of size to <i>Kogia</i>, and it is interesting to note
  that its relatively-shorter snout is also suggestive of the dwarf
  Cachalot. The general outline of the skull is, however, more like that of
  <i>Physeter</i>, and there is the same deep cavity for the lodgment of
  spermaceti. The main feature of interest in the skull is the presence of
  teeth in both jaws, and the fact that two or three are lodged in the
  premaxillae. This is precisely what is found in the most ancient Whales,
  the Zeuglodonts.</p>

  <p>Extinct Dolphins, apparently referable to the Platanistidae, are the
  most numerous among the earlier forms of Cetaceans, and it is significant
  that the earliest known forms of these go back to the Eocene.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Iniopsis</i> of Mr. Lydekker,<a name="NtA_254"
  href="#Nt_254"><sup>[254]</sup></a> with one species, <i>I.
  caucasica</i>, comes from rocks which seem to be of that age. The back
  part of the skull of this animal, the only part of the skull known, has
  the same squarish excavation of the maxillaries that characterises
  <i>Inia</i> and <i>Pontoporia</i>. Its lower jaw was slender and
  possessed numerous teeth.</p>

  <p>The long snout and jaws of Platanistids, especially exaggerated in
  <i>Pontoporia</i> among living forms, are constantly found in these
  Tertiary Platanistids.</p>

  <p><i>Eurhinodelphis</i> had a beak three and a half times the length of
  the cranium, whereas in <i>Pontoporia</i> the proportions are as 2:1. The
  teeth too were very numerous.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Argyrocetus</i>, from Patagonian Tertiary strata, was an
  animal about as large as the existing Dolphin. It had the <!-- Page 384
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page384"></a>{384}</span>slender
  rostrum and numerous teeth of the Platanistids and the squared
  excavations of the maxillaries. <i>Argyrocetus patagonicus</i> possessed
  also archaic characters, suggesting earlier affinities still. The two
  condyles of the skull instead of being closely adpressed to the skull
  stood out in a way more like that met with in terrestrial mammals. The
  nasal bones instead of being abbreviated rudiments are well developed as
  in the archaic Zeuglodonts. The cervical vertebrae of this Whale are all
  perfectly free from each other and individually long. The skull is on the
  whole bilaterally symmetrical; this again is a feature more pronounced
  among the Platanistidae than among other Odontocetes. Accompanying these
  generalised Cetacean characters are some which show that the animal was
  too specialised to be the direct ancestor of any existing forms. The end
  of the mandible was upturned and without teeth, its form being quite
  unique among Cetacea. Other allied forms, such as <i>Zarrhachis</i> and
  <i>Priscodelphinus</i>, showed the same length of the cervical
  vertebrae.</p>

  <p>A very distinct family of extinct Whales is that of the
  <b>Squalodontidae</b>. They to some extent bridge over the gap between
  the existing Odontoceti and the Eocene Archaeoceti (Zeuglodonts).</p>

  <p>The skull of these Whales was on the whole Dolphin-like. But they
  possessed teeth which were distinctly specialised into incisors, canines,
  and molars. The molars have a coarsely-serrated cutting edge as in the
  Zeuglodonts, and are also to some extent two-rooted. But they are more
  numerous, and so far approximate to the conditions which characterise the
  more typical modern Odontocetes. <i>Squalodon</i> was a long-beaked form,
  and <i>Prosqualodon</i> had a skull whose proportions are nearer those of
  <i>Kogia</i>.</p>

<h5><span class="sc">Sub-Order 3.</span> ARCHAEOCETI.</h5>

  <p>This division of the Whale tribe embraces but a single family,
  <b>Zeuglodontidae</b>, of which but a single genus, <i>Zeuglodon</i>, can
  with certainty be discriminated.</p>

  <p><i>Zeuglodon</i> is an Eocene form of large size, with teeth which are
  limited in number and disposed in three series as incisors, canines, and
  molars. The molars are double-rooted, a fact which has given to the genus
  its name. The nasal bones being long <!-- Page 385 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page385"></a>{385}</span>instead of rudimentary
  like those of other Whales, the blow-hole lies more in the middle of the
  face. The skull, too, is not Whale-like in a number of other points. Thus
  the premaxillaries take their fair share in the outline of the upper jaw;
  and, furthermore, bear the incisor teeth. The parietals meet above in a
  crest and are not excluded from the roof of the skull. The vertebrae of
  the neck are in no way shortened; neither are they fused together. The
  ribs are double-headed, and the sternum is made up of several pieces.
  Some naturalists, particularly Professor D'Arcy Thompson,<a
  name="NtA_255" href="#Nt_255"><sup>[255]</sup></a> have assigned a
  relationship to the Seals to these ancient Cetacea; but others<a
  name="NtA_256" href="#Nt_256"><sup>[256]</sup></a> have disputed this
  view chiefly on the grounds that the characters which appear to be
  Seal-like are simply characters which are generalised and so far at most
  not Whale-like. Thus the long neck and the serrated character of the
  teeth may be accepted as Seal-like on the one hand; but on the other, a
  simple serrated tooth and a long neck are not by any means features of
  organisation which we should consider out of the way in an ancient form
  of Cetacean which probably preyed upon fish. The humerus of
  <i>Zeuglodon</i>, according to Mr. Lydekker, puts out of court any
  possible near relationship to the Seals. But the matter under dispute can
  be further studied by reference to the three memoirs quoted below.</p>

<h6>CARNIVORA<a name="NtA_257" href="#Nt_257"><sup>[257]</sup></a>&mdash;FISSIPEDIA</h6>

<h5><b>Order VII. CARNIVORA</b></h5>

  <p>This order may be thus defined<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span>Small to
  large quadrupeds, terrestrial, arboreal, or aquatic, of usually
  carnivorous habits. The teeth have generally sharp and cutting edges, and
  the canines are well developed; the incisors are small, and four to six
  in number. The number of toes is never less than four. There are usually
  strong and sharp claws. The clavicles are incomplete or absent. In the
  hand the scaphoid and lunar bones are always united. The brain is well
  developed, and the hemispheres are well convoluted. The stomach is always
  simple, while the caecum, if present, is always small. The members of
  this group have a deciduate and zonary placenta.</p>

  <p>The fewness of the characters used in the above definition is chiefly
  owing to the fact that the Seals and Sea-lions, although they are
  referable without a doubt to this order, have undergone in their
  metamorphosis into aquatic animals so many changes that some of the main
  features in the structure of their terrestrial relatives have been lost.
  This group will, however, be again characterised. We shall deal at
  present with the land division of the Carnivora, the <span
  class="sc">Carnivora Fissipedia</span> as they are generally termed. The
  name is of course given to them to distinguish them from the
  corresponding division of the <span class="sc">Pinnipedia</span>. In the
  latter group the feet and hands are modified into "fins"; in the other
  the fingers and toes are cleft, as with terrestrial beasts generally.

  <p>A very marked feature of the terrestrial Carnivora is to be found in
  the structure of the teeth. The incisors are nearly always six, and are
  somewhat feebly developed in many cases. The canines are almost
  invariably very large strong teeth, and are always present. In some of
  the extinct Cats they reached enormous dimensions. The number of cheek
  teeth is not always identical; but the last premolar in the upper jaw and
  the first true molar in the lower jaw, known as the "carnassial" or
  "sectorial" teeth, mark a difference in structure between the anterior
  and the posterior crushing teeth; those in front of the carnassial tooth
  have cutting edges, and are often merely small, conical teeth; those
  behind have broader crowns and are tuberculate; those of simpler forms
  often trituberculate; those of others <!-- Page 388 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page388"></a>{388}</span>with numerous
  tubercles. The carnassial tooth is often, but by no means always, very
  much larger and especially longer than the rest of the molar and premolar
  series. It is less pronounced in some of the omnivorous Arctoidea. The
  skull of the Carnivora is longer in the more primitive types, such as the
  Canidae, and shorter in the more specialised Felidae. The orbit is hardly
  ever completely shut off by bone, though the postorbital process of the
  frontal sometimes approaches the corresponding upward process of the
  zygomatic arch. The palate, which is completely ossified, sometimes
  reaches back for some distance behind the teeth; it always extends as far
  as the last molar. The tympanic bulla is often very inflated, and if
  flatter, as in the Bears, is at any rate large and conspicuous. The lower
  jaw has a high coronoid process, and the condyle is transversely
  elongated, this part of the bone being rolled into an almost cylindrical
  form; it fits very closely into the glenoid cavity, and the articulation
  is thereby very strict&mdash;an obvious advantage in a creature with so
  great a need for power of jaw.</p>

  <p>In the vertebral column the atlas always has large wing-like
  processes; the spine of the axis vertebra has a long antero-posteriorly
  elongated form. The transverse processes of the fourth to the sixth
  cervicals are, as a rule, double. These features, however, though
  characteristic of the Carnivora are not by any means distinctive. The
  true sacrum consists of but a single vertebra to which the ilia are
  attached; but at most two other vertebrae are fused with this. The
  clavicle is always small and sometimes quite rudimentary, or even absent.
  The spine of the scapula is well developed, and almost equally divides
  the <!-- Page 389 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page389"></a>{389}</span>surface of that bone. The digits of the
  Carnivora are mostly five, and are never less than four. The mode of
  progression may be digitigrade or plantigrade, and the intermediate
  semidigitigrade mode of walking also occurs. The brain in all Carnivora
  is large and well convoluted. The arrangement of the convolutions is
  characteristic. There are three or four gyri disposed round each other,
  of which the lowest surrounds the Sylvian fissure. The stomach in these
  creatures is always simple in form, without <!-- Page 390 --><span

  <p>The distribution of the Carnivora is world-wide, excluding only the
  Australian region, if, as seems probable, the Dingo of that region is an
  introduced species. The most striking features in their distribution are
  perhaps the following<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span>There are no Bears
  in the Ethiopian region or in Madagascar, and but a single species in the
  Neotropical. The only Carnivora in Madagascar are the Viverridae, and of
  the seven genera there found six are peculiar. The Procyonidae are nearly
  entirely New World in range; out of sixteen genera of Mustelidae only
  five are New World, and only two of those are peculiar to the American
  continent. The Hyaenidae are limited to the Old World.</p>

  <p>The classification of the Carnivora is a matter which is difficult,
  and which has therefore been very variously effected. It is unfortunate
  that the classification of Flower (based upon the researches of H. N.
  Turner as well as his own, and accepted by Mivart) should fail when
  applied to fossil forms. For it separates with great clearness the
  existing genera into three great divisions, the Cynoidea, Aeluroidea, and
  Arctoidea, definable by visceral as well as by osteological characters.
  The apparent anomaly, too, of a single supposed Viverrine genus, to wit
  <i>Bassariscus</i>, existing in America, while all the rest of its kin
  are Old-World forms, was shown by his characters to be neither an anomaly
  nor a fact. It will be better, therefore, to divide the Carnivora into
  the families, Felidae, Machaerodontidae, Viverridae, Hyaenidae, Canidae,
  Ursidae, Procyonidae, and Mustelidae, indicating at the same time the
  reasons for and against retaining the three divisions of Sir W.
  Flower.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Felidae.</b><a name="NtA_258"
  href="#Nt_258"><sup>[258]</sup></a>&mdash;This family includes only the
  Cats (<i>i.e.</i> Lions, Tigers, "Cats," Hunting Leopard, etc.), and is
  to be distinguished by the following characters<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span>In the skull the auditory bulla is much
  inflated, and there is an internal septum; the paroccipital processes are
  flattened against the bullae. There is no alisphenoidal canal. The dental
  formula is I&nbsp;3, C&nbsp;1, Pm&nbsp;3 to 2, M&nbsp;1. The carnassial tooth of the upper
  jaw has three lobes to the blade; that of the lower jaw is without an
  inner cusp. <!-- Page 391 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page391"></a>{391}</span>The digits are five on the fore-feet, four
  on the hind. The caecum is present and small. This family contains but
  two genera, <i>Felis</i> and <i>Cynaelurus</i>.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Felis</i> is very wide in its distribution, being common
  to both the Old and the New Worlds. Its distinctive characters, as
  opposed to <i>Cynaelurus</i>, are mainly the following<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span>The claws are retractile, and the retractility
  is more markedly developed than in the Cheetah. The molar is not so
  nearly in a line with the other teeth; the upper carnassial, moreover,
  has an inner tubercle. The legs are relatively shorter.</p>

  <p>The complete retractility of the claws is a very distinctive feature
  of the true Cats. It is brought about in this way: the terminal joint of
  the toe, which is clad with the claw, folds back into a sheath by the
  outer side of or above the middle phalanx. It is held in this position by
  a strong ligament. The flexor muscles straighten the phalanx which bears
  the claw, so that the natural position for the animal is to be in a state
  of retracted claws, which of course preserves them from friction; when
  wanted for aggressive purposes, they are pulled into sight by the action
  of the muscles already mentioned.</p>

  <p>Much has been written as to the shape of the pupil of the Cat's eye.
  Some careful observations upon the matter have been <!-- Page 392
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page392"></a>{392}</span>made by Dr.
  Lindsay Johnson,<a name="NtA_259" href="#Nt_259"><sup>[259]</sup></a> who
  found that out of 180 Domestic Cats 111 had round pupils, and that in 19
  the shape was a pointed oval, intermediate conditions being offered by
  the rest. These 180 comprised males and females of many varieties. When
  the pupil of the Cat's eye contracts, it forms a vertical slit with two
  pin holes, one at each end, through which alone light appears to enter.
  In the Genet and the Civet the contraction of the pupil is as in the Cat.
  In the Lion, Tiger&mdash;in fact apparently in all the large
  Cats&mdash;the pupil retains its circular shape even when contraction is
  fully effected. Dr. Johnson has, furthermore,<a name="NtA_260"
  href="#Nt_260"><sup>[260]</sup></a> made some interesting experiments
  upon the Seal's eye&mdash;a creature which has, of course, to exert its
  powers of vision in two media, and from one to the other. This is
  effected by dilatation of the pupil when in the water, and its
  contraction to a vertical slit with parallel margins and rounded ends
  when in the air, the contraction being to some extent at least under the
  influence of the animal's will.</p>

  <p>The coloration of these creatures is very varied: spots of black, or
  bordered with black upon a more or less tawny ground-colour, is the
  prevailing pattern. Stripes are also met with, as in the Tiger, but these
  are usually cross stripes,<a name="NtA_261"
  href="#Nt_261"><sup>[261]</sup></a> while in the related Viverridae there
  are many examples of longitudinal stripes. Finally, many Cats, as for
  instance the Puma and the Eyra, are "self-coloured"&mdash;have, that is
  to say, a uniform tint. Just as the unstriped Horse sometimes shows
  traces of the former existence of stripes, so the self-coloured Cats are
  occasionally spotted when young; this is markedly so in the case of the
  Puma; while the Lion is spotted as a cub, and in the
  adult&mdash;particularly in the lioness&mdash;there are distinct
  indications of these spots. It is evident, therefore, that there are
  grounds for regarding a spotted condition to be antecedent, at least in
  some cases, to a uniform colour. There are divers explanations of these
  hues and of these changes. It is held by many that the coloration has a
  relation to the habits of the creature: the spotted Cats, it is pointed
  out, are largely arboreal; this is eminently so with the Jaguar at any
  rate; and in an arboreal <!-- Page 393 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page393"></a>{393}</span>creature the spots, it is said, give the
  impression of flecks of sunlight broken up by foliage. On the other hand,
  the self-coloured Cats of a sandy to earthen hue assimilate in tint with
  a sandy or stony soil. The stripes of the Tiger, it is thought,
  approximate to the tall parallel stems of grasses and other plants in the
  dense cover in which it lives. In favour of these views is undoubtedly
  the fact that in other mammals and other animals belonging to quite
  different groups the same four plans of coloration are met with. Spots
  and cross stripes are found in the Marsupials; the young Tapir is spotted
  while the adult is self-coloured, and so forth. This last fact, however,
  serves to illustrate another view which has been put forward in
  explanation of these characteristic markings of the Felidae. Eimer has
  come to the conclusion that there is and has been a regular series of
  steps in the evolution of these markings. The primitive condition was, he
  thinks, a longitudinally striped one; the stripes then broke up into
  spots, and the spots rearranged themselves as transverse stripes; the
  self-coloured Puma and Lion are a final stage in this gradual evolution.
  In support of this is the fact that spots precede self-coloration in the
  individual growth of these animals. The exact sequence of these markings
  is, however, contradicted by Dr. Haacke's observations upon a certain
  Australian fish which is cross striped when young and longitudinally
  striped when adult, a precise reversal of what ought to occur on Eimer's
  view.</p>

  <p>The Felidae are almost universally distributed with the exception, of
  course, of Australia and a good deal of the Australian region; the
  headquarters of the group are undoubtedly in the tropics of the Old
  World.</p>

  <p>The characteristics of a few species of the Cat tribe will now be
  given. As there are at any rate forty-five species, this survey will have
  to be somewhat incomplete.</p>

  <p>The Lion, <i>F. leo</i>, differs from all other species by the mane of
  the male. It is an inhabitant of Africa, India, and certain parts of
  Western Asia. Within the historic period it ranged into Europe. According
  to Sir Samuel Baker those of us who have not seen the Lion in his native
  haunts have never seen a really magnificent specimen of the brute; but
  other travellers disagree, and state that a captive Lion is often a finer
  animal&mdash;by reason, of course, of good feeding. Unlike the majority
  of Cats, the Lion <!-- Page 394 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page394"></a>{394}</span>cannot climb. His roar (which is so
  suggestive, towards its end, of that animal who once dressed himself up
  in his skin) is literally <i>after</i> his prey. The Lion, it is stated,
  does not roar except upon a full stomach. The Lion is mainly nocturnal in
  its habits, and is said to be not in the least dangerous if unprovoked in
  the daytime; but here again opinions differ. The tail of the animal is
  provided at the extremity with a slight claw, but it can hardly be
  sufficient for the animal to lash itself into a fury with it. A Lion will
  live for thirty or forty years, and will breed freely in captivity. The
  Gardens of the Zoological Society of Dublin have been famed for their
  success in breeding Lions; but more surprising still, this has been
  successfully accomplished in travelling menageries. The "desert" colour
  of the Lion is familiar to all. It is stated that the likeness to the
  parched soil of certain parts of Africa is greatly heightened by black
  patches in the mane, for in certain regions of that continent the arid
  yellow of the general environment is diversified by pieces of black lava.
  It is apparently a popular delusion to speak of the Maneless Lion of
  Guzerat. No doubt maneless Lions do come from there, but so do young and
  maneless Lions from other places; in short, it is simply a question of
  age, and old Lions from the Asiatic continent are as fully maned as those
  from Africa.</p>

  <p>The Tiger, <i>F. tigris</i>, is an animal of about the same size as
  the Lion, distinguished, of course, by the stripes. The skeletons are
  much like those of other Cats; but the skull of the Tiger may be
  distinguished from that of the Lion by the fact that the nasal bones
  reach back beyond the frontal processes of the maxillae. The Tiger is an
  exclusively Asiatic beast, ranging northward into icy Siberia. The
  northern individuals have a closer fur, and have been quite unnecessarily
  separated as a distinct variety. Nine feet six inches is the size of the
  average full-grown Tiger; but the skins will stretch, a fact of which the
  sportsman will sometimes take advantage. A "man-eater" is a Tiger which
  has discovered "that it is far easier to kill a native than to hunt for
  the scarce jungle game." As with the Lion, the accounts of travellers
  differ enormously, particularly with regard to the strength of the
  creature. Some have said that a Tiger can easily lift a full-grown
  bullock and leap with it in the mouth over a considerable obstacle, a
  statement which is ridiculed by Sir Samuel Baker. Unlike the Lion, the
  Tiger can climb trees; <!-- Page 395 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page395"></a>{395}</span>it will also voluntarily enter the water,
  and can swim considerable rivers.</p>

  <p>Mr. H. N. Ridley<a name="NtA_262" href="#Nt_262"><sup>[262]</sup></a>
  observes that Tigers "habitually swim over to Singapore across the Johore
  Strait, usually by way of the intermediate islands of Pulau Ubin and
  Pulau Tekong. They make the passage at night, landing in the early
  morning. As so much of the coast is mangrove swamp, and the animals do
  not risk going through the mud, they are only able to cross where the
  shores are sandy, and thus they have regular starting- and
  landing-places."</p>

  <p>The Tiger is mainly nocturnal, but begins its depredations towards
  five o'clock in the afternoon, before which it remains sleeping in shady
  thickets. If the weather is rainy and windy it becomes restless and
  wanders about earlier. Under the provocation of extreme hunger it will
  hunt during the daytime. Hunger, too, naturally produces extreme
  boldness. Mr. Ridley relates a story of four Tigers who walked up the
  steps of a house in search of the master of the house or his dog, and
  broke into it, the inhabitants retiring in their favour. The Malays have
  superstitions about Tigers, which are precisely paralleled by the
  man-and-wolf stories of Europe. "Certain people are supposed to have the
  power of turning into tigers for a short time, and resuming their human
  form at pleasure. The transformation commences tail first, and the human
  tiger is so completely changed that not only has it all the actions and
  appearance of the tiger, but on resuming its human form it is quite
  unconscious of what it has been doing in the tiger state." Mr. Ridley
  disputes the common stories as to man-eaters. If a Tiger has once tasted
  human flesh it does not always confine itself afterwards to that article
  of diet, nor is it only aged and comparatively toothless animals which
  hunt man. That they do take a large toll of coolies is an undoubted fact,
  and many are the artifices to prevent the rest from knowing the fate of
  one of their fellow-workmen, or of becoming acquainted with the presence
  in the neighbourhood of one of the dreaded beasts.</p>

  <p>The Leopard or Panther, <i>F. pardus</i>, is, like the Lion, African
  and Asiatic in range. The animal is spotted with rosettes of black spots
  surrounding a central field of the tawny colour of the body generally.
  Some of the spots are solid and black. "The <!-- Page 396 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page396"></a>{396}</span>pantere like unto the
  smaragdyne" seems to be an inapt description of this Cat, unless indeed
  the eyes be referred to. The ancients ascribed to it a most fragrant
  odour. As with the Tiger, a northern variety of this Carnivore has a
  closer and longer fur. There is a tendency towards melanism in this
  animal, the black Leopard being comparatively common, particularly, it
  appears, in high lands. Several other variations in colour are known.
  These have received different specific names; but it seems that there is
  in reality but one species of Leopard. The Leopard can climb with the
  agility of any Cat. Sir S. Baker reserves the name Panther for large
  Leopards, which reach a length of 7 feet 6 inches. But there is no valid
  distinction between any two such varieties. The Leopard is as ferocious
  as the Tiger; and Sir Samuel Baker advises that the power of the human
  eye be not experimented with when meeting unarmed one of these
  brutes.</p>

<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 195.&mdash;Snow Leopard. <i>Felis uncia.</i> × <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">20</span>.</p>

  <p>The Snow Leopard or Ounce, <i>F. uncia</i>, is a beautiful creature,
  confined to the highlands of Central Asia. The ground-colour is white,
  and the spots are larger than those of the ordinary Leopard. Two examples
  of this rather rare Carnivore have been recently on view in the
  Zoological Society's Gardens, London. The Clouded Leopard, <i>F.
  nebulosa</i>, is an animal of considerable size (6 feet total length).
  <!-- Page 397 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page397"></a>{397}</span></p>

  <p>The Fishing Cat, <i>F. viverrina</i>, of India and China, is about 3
  feet 6 inches including the tail. Its black spots upon a grey-brown
  ground have a tendency to form longitudinal lines. It is in fact, on
  Eimer's theory, a case of longitudinal stripes breaking up into spots. It
  differs from the bulk of Cats by preying upon fish, though it is not
  known how it catches them. It also feeds upon the large snail
  <i>Ampullaria</i>. In addition to these there are twenty-four species of
  Cats found in the Old World, mainly in the Oriental region, of small to
  moderate size.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:42%;">
      <a href="images/196.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/196.jpg"

<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 196.&mdash;European Lynx. <i>Felis lynx.</i> × <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">12</span>.</p>

  <p>The European Lynx, <i>F. lynx</i>, has rather long legs, a short tail,
  and tufted, pointed ears. It has only two premolars in the upper jaw
  instead of the usual three. It seems to be doubtful whether the Asiatic
  Lynx can be distinguished from the European, but the Spanish form, <i>F.
  pardina</i>, does appear to be distinct. The Common Lynx, sometimes
  called <i>F. canadensis</i>, also ranges into America, where some other
  forms exist, known by the specific names of <i>F. rufa</i> and <i>F.
  baileyi</i>.</p>

  <p>In America there are altogether sixteen species of Cats, if we allow
  three species of Lynx, none of which, however, does Dr. Mivart allow to
  be different from the European and Asiatic Lynx (<i>F. lynx</i>). <!--
  Page 398 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page398"></a>{398}</span></p>

  <p>The largest of American Cats is the Jaguar, <i>F. onca</i>. This is an
  arboreal creature with a long, heavy body and short limbs. Its pelage is
  much like that of the Leopard, but the spots are larger and more
  definitely arranged in groups. There are a number of distinct rows of
  spots. The length of the body alone is not greater than 4 feet. They prey
  very largely on the Capybara, and upon turtles, which they surprise upon
  the sand when about to lay their eggs; the reptiles are turned upon their
  backs, so as to be incapable of escaping, and the Jaguar then easily
  devours them. The Jaguar will even pursue the turtle into the water, and
  will devour its eggs and the newly-hatched young.</p>

  <p>The Ocelot is another spotted American Cat. <i>F. pardalis</i><a
  name="NtA_263" href="#Nt_263"><sup>[263]</sup></a> ranges from Arkansas
  in North America southwards, its range corresponding with that of the
  Jaguar. Although small for one of the "larger cats," the Ocelot inspired
  with considerable respect Captain Dampier, who remarked of it: "The
  Tigre-cat is about the bigness of a bull-dog, with short truss, body
  shaped much like a mastiff, but in all things else, its head, the colour
  of its hair, the manner of its preying, much resembling the <!-- Page 399
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page399"></a>{399}</span>tigre, only
  somewhat less.... But I have wisht them farther off when I have met them
  in the woods; because their aspect appears so very stately and
  fierce."</p>

  <p>The Puma, <i>F. concolor</i>, the American Lion as it is called in the
  north, is a rather smaller animal than the last, and of a uniform tawny
  colour, tending to white on the abdomen and to a dark stripe along the
  back. The young, as already mentioned, are very distinctly spotted. Like
  the Tiger, the Puma can endure extremes of heat and cold; it is equally
  at home in the snow of North America and among the tropical forests and
  swamps of the south. It is a ferocious creature so far as concerns Deer,
  Lamas, Raccoons, even Skunks and Rheas, but, according to Mr. W. H.
  Hudson, will not attack man, and will even defend him against the
  Jaguar.<a name="NtA_264" href="#Nt_264"><sup>[264]</sup></a> In captivity
  the Puma will purr like a Cat.</p>

  <p>The Eyra, <i>F. eyra</i>, is another self-coloured American cat, which
  has a curious likeness to the totally distinct <i>Cryptoprocta</i> of
  Madagascar.</p>

  <p>The Wild Cat of Europe, <i>F. catus</i>, is found over the greater
  part of Europe, and also in Northern Asia. It was undoubtedly common at
  one time in this country, though it appears never to have extended its
  range into Ireland. But the real Wild Cat is now rare in this island, and
  is confined to certain districts in <!-- Page 400 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page400"></a>{400}</span>Scotland. Plenty of
  alleged wild Cats have been seen and even shot; but these are too
  frequently merely feral Cats, <i>i.e.</i> domestic tabbies which have
  reverted to a hunting life. The real Wild Cat differs from the domestic
  races by the proportionately longer body and limbs, the shorter and
  thicker tail; the pads of the toes are not quite black. The period of the
  gestation of the Wild Cat, according to Mr. Cocks, is a week or so longer
  than that of any domestic Cat.</p>

  <p>The Domestic Cat is in fact regarded as the descendant of the Eastern
  <i>F. caffra</i>, or (perhaps <i>and</i>) the closely-allied <i>F.
  maniculata</i>. It is highly probable, however, that after introduction
  into this country as a domestic animal it has interbred with the Wild
  Cat. Many allied species of Cats will interbreed, even two so far apart
  as the Lion and the Tiger. There are interesting archaeological and
  linguistic reasons for regarding the Domestic Cat as an importation. The
  legend of Dick Whittington's Cat points to it being a rare and valuable
  animal, which a tamed <i>F. catus</i> would not at that time have been.
  There was an enactment in Wales of a penalty against him who should kill
  the king's Cat, again suggestive of its rarity and consequent value. The
  very name "Puss" is a hint of a foreign origin. Some would derive it from
  Perse, and upon this is based the notion that the Cat is from Persia. But
  it seems that Puss is the same as Pasht and Bubastis, showing so far an
  Egyptian origin for the animal. The ancestral Cats mentioned above are
  natives of Egypt.<a name="NtA_265"
  href="#Nt_265"><sup>[265]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The genus <i>Cynaelurus</i>, which includes but a single species,
  <i>C. jubatus</i>, the Cheetah or Hunting Leopard, is separated from
  <i>Felis</i> by a number of characters. In the first place the claws are
  non-retractile, or at least less retractile than those of the true Cats.
  It is, moreover, longer legged. The molar is more in a line with the
  other teeth of the jaw, and the upper carnassial tooth has no inner
  tubercle. Messrs. Windle and Parsons have lately pointed out many
  Dog-like features in the muscles. This animal is about as large as a
  Leopard, but has plain black spots. As its vernacular name implies it is
  used for sport, and is quite easily tameable. It will purr like the Puma.
  The Cheetah occurs in India, Persia, Turkestan, and also in Africa; the
  latter <!-- Page 401 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page401"></a>{401}</span>form is sometimes, though quite
  unnecessarily, separated as <i>C. lanigera</i>. The genus occurs fossil
  in the Siwalik deposits of India, the species being known as <i>C.
  brachygnatha</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Machaerodontidae.</b>&mdash;This is a family of
  totally-extinct Cats which range from the Eocene down to the Pleistocene.
  Their general structure is like that of the Felidae; but they differ in a
  number of skeletal features. Thus there is an alisphenoid canal, and, as
  in Bears, there is a postglenoid foramen. There is also a distinct
  carotid foramen, which does not occur in the true Cats. The teeth are
  often distinguished by the huge size of the superior canines, which are
  "weapons for penetrating wounds, without rival among carnivorous
  animals." These must have been displayed at the sides of the chin when
  the mouth was closed, and it has even been suggested that the animal
  possessing these exaggerated canines could hardly have properly closed
  its mouth. The lower canines were often on the contrary much reduced, and
  in fact incisor-like. In tracing the series of these Cats we find a
  gradual reduction of the teeth from a more nearly complete number down to
  the specialised dentition of the existing Cats. The genus
  <i>Proaelurus</i>, Miocene in range, had four premolars in each jaw, and
  two molars in the lower and one in the upper. This is the greatest number
  of teeth found in any member of the group.</p>

  <p>The resemblance of this genus to <i>Cryptoprocta</i> has been insisted
  upon. <i>Archaelurus</i> has suffered a reduction, since one premolar in
  the lower jaw has disappeared, its formula being thus I&nbsp;3/3 C&nbsp;1/1 Pm&nbsp;4/3
  M&nbsp;1/2. The next stage is shown by <i>Dinictis</i> with three premolars in
  both jaws. There are a good many species of this genus which are all
  American and Miocene. This genus has five toes upon the hind-feet, and
  was probably plantigrade. It had retractile claws.</p>

  <p>In the genus <i>Nimravus</i> the dental formula is still further
  reduced. Another premolar of the lower jaw has gone, the formula being
  thus I&nbsp;3/3 C&nbsp;1/1 Pm&nbsp;3/2 M&nbsp;1/2. <i>Nimravus gomphodus</i> was a Carnivore
  about the size of a Panther. It has no third trochanter upon the femur,
  which process is present in the corresponding bone of <i>Dinictis</i>.
  <i>Pogonodon</i> was an equally large animal in which the premolars were
  three in each jaw, but the molars have become reduced to one in the
  lower, as they have in this and other genera in the upper <!-- Page 402
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page402"></a>{402}</span>jaw. Finally,
  <i>Hoplophoneus</i> has acquired the dentition of existing Cats.</p>

  <p>The Machaerodons, however, show examples with a yet more reduced
  dentition than that of the most reduced existing Cat, viz. the Lynx,
  which has only two premolars in each jaw and one molar. In
  <i>Eusmilus</i> the molar in both jaws is single, and there is but one

  <p>The genus <i>Machaerodus</i> itself, which appears to include
  <i>Smilodon</i>, is referred by Cope to the true Cats, and not to the
  Nimravidae, as he terms the family which we have called here the
  Machaerodontidae. These creatures are known as "Sabre-toothed Tigers,"
  and were of very wide distribution, occurring in South America as well as
  in Europe and North America. "As nothing," remarks Professor Cope, "but
  the characters of the canine teeth distinguished these from typical
  felines, it is to these that we must look for the cause of their failure
  to continue. Professor Flower's suggestion appears to be a good one, viz.
  that the length of these teeth became an inconvenience and a hindrance to
  their possessors. I think there can be no doubt that the huge canines in
  the Smilodons must have prevented the biting off of flesh from large
  pieces, so as to greatly interfere with feeding, and to keep the animals
  in poor condition. The size of the canines is such as to prevent their
  use as cutting instruments excepting with the mouth closed; for the
  latter could not have been opened sufficiently to allow any object to
  enter it from the front. Even when it opens so far as to allow the
  mandible to pass behind the apices of the canines, there would appear to
  be some risk of the latter being caught on the point of one or the other
  canine, and forced to remain open, causing early starvation. Such may
  have been the fate of the fine individual of the <i>S. neogaeus</i>,
  Lund, whose skull was found in Brazil by Lund, and which is familiar to
  us through the figures of de Blainville."</p>

  <p><i>Machaerodus</i> is placed among the Felidae on account of the fact
  that the condyloid and carotid foramina unite with the foramen lacerum
  posterius. But as in at least one species, <i>M. palmidens</i>, there is
  an alisphenoid canal, which, however, has disappeared in the more recent
  American forms, it seems permissible to retain the genus in the family
  Machaerodontidae though its existence reduces the differential character
  of that family to a minimum. The genus goes back to the Eocene. <!-- Page
  403 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page403"></a>{403}</span></p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Viverridae.</b>&mdash;The Civets, Genets, and their kind
  differ from the Cats in a number of points. They form, however, by no
  means so uniform an assemblage as do the Cats; so that the difficulty is,
  as Dr. Mivart has remarked, not to divide them into sub-families, but to
  avoid making too many. But before proceeding to subdivide the family we
  shall describe the characters of the family and contrast them with those
  of the Felidae.</p>

  <p>All the Viverridae are comparatively small creatures. The head and
  body are more elongate than in the Cats. The fingers and toes are
  generally five; but there are some (e.g. <i>Cynictis</i>) where the
  formula of the toes is as in the Cats, <i>i.e.</i> four on the hind-foot.
  In the Suricate the fingers are also reduced to four. The claws are
  perhaps never completely retractile,<a name="NtA_266"
  href="#Nt_266"><sup>[266]</sup></a> and often are not at all so. The
  dental formulae of the genera differ considerably; but in the majority
  there are more teeth than in the Felidae. The well-known sharp-pointed,
  conical papillae of the Cat's tongue are not present. The majority have a
  scent gland beneath the tail, from which the perfume civet is derived.
  There are a number of osteological characters which differentiate the two
  families; thus the alisphenoid canal is sometimes present. The bulla is
  divided, as in the Cats, but is externally constricted.</p>

  <p>It seems clear from some at any rate of the characters, <i>i.e.</i>
  the more complete dentition, the five-fingered hands and feet, the
  non-retractile claws, etc., that the Civets are on a lower level of
  specialisation than are the Cats.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 1. Euplerinae.</b>&mdash;The genus <i>Eupleres</i> is in
  many ways the most aberrant type of Viverrid, and is placed in a
  sub-family, Euplerinae. Its salient feature is the very peculiar
  dentition: peculiar in the small size of the canines, the canine-like
  character of the anterior premolars, and the resemblance of the premolars
  to molars. In some of the characters of the teeth, <i>Eupleres</i> is
  Insectivore-like, and was formerly grouped with that family. There are
  four premolars and two molars in each jaw on each side. It has five toes
  upon both fore- and hind-limbs; the skull is very slender. It has no
  alisphenoid canal. The only species, <i>E. goudotii</i>, is of an
  olive-grey colour, with dark bands across the shoulders in the young. The
  nose and upper lip are grooved. There are no scent glands. It appears to
  burrow in the ground, and possibly contents itself with a diet of worms.
  <i>Eupleres</i> is a <!-- Page 404 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page404"></a>{404}</span>native of Madagascar, where all the most
  peculiar Viverridae live.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 2. Galidictiinae.</b>&mdash;Mivart has placed in this
  sub-family the three Mascarene genera, <i>Galidia</i>,
  <i>Hemigalidia</i>, and <i>Galidictis</i>. In them the orbit is not
  enclosed by bone; there is no alisphenoid canal, and there are five toes
  and fingers.</p>

  <p><i>Galidia</i> consists of but one species, <i>G. elegans</i>, of a
  chestnut brown colour, with a tail ringed with black. The claws are not
  retractile. The scent gland is absent. There are five digits upon both
  hand and foot. There are three premolars and two molars on each side of
  each jaw. The caecum is (for an Aeluroid) long, and pointed at the apex;
  it is quite twice the length of that of <i>Genetta</i>.</p>

  <p>Closely allied to <i>Galidia</i> is the genus <i>Hemigalidia</i>, of
  which there are two species. It is distinguished from the last genus by
  the non-annulated tail. It also differs in the dental formula, which is
  for the molars Pm&nbsp;4/3 M&nbsp;2/1. This animal is termed by Buffon the Vansire.
  He correctly enumerates its grinders, and distinguishes it from the
  Ferret!</p>

  <p><i>Galidictis</i> is a third genus from Madagascar containing two
  species, one of which has been unfortunately named <i>G. vittata</i>,
  leading perhaps to some confusion with the totally distinct <i>Galictis
  vittata</i>. As in the last two genera the digits are five. The dental
  formula is that of <i>Galidia</i>. It is distinguished from the other two
  genera of its sub-family by the longitudinal brown striping of the upper
  part of the greyish body.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 3. Cryptoproctinae.</b>&mdash;<i>Cryptoprocta</i><a
  name="NtA_267" href="#Nt_267"><sup>[267]</sup></a> represents a special
  sub-family, Cryptoproctinae, and includes only a single species, the
  Fossa (<i>C. ferox</i>) of Madagascar. It is the largest Carnivore of
  Madagascar, being about twice the size of a Cat, but with an elongated
  body; the colour is a tawny brown with no striping. The animal is active
  and lithe in its motions, and is said to be of almost unexampled ferocity
  in disposition. Its exact systematic position has been much discussed. By
  Zittel it is placed in a sub-family (including the extinct
  <i>Proaelurus</i> and <i>Pseudaelurus</i>) of the Felidae. Mivart and
  Lydekker, on the other hand, regard it as a genus of the Viverridae. The
  dental formula of the molars, Pm&nbsp;3/3 M&nbsp;1/1, is <!-- Page 405 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page405"></a>{405}</span>more like that of the
  <i>Felidae</i> than of the <i>Viverridae</i>, and the teeth are more
  Feline in structure. The claws of the feet are retractile. As to internal
  structure the Fossa agrees largely with the Viverridae, but then this
  family has no very marked points of difference from the Felidae; but
  where the anatomy does diverge from that of the Felidae it approaches the
  Viverridae, especially in the muscular system.</p>

  <p>The remaining and by far the larger number of genera of Civets are
  grouped by Professor Mivart in two sub-families: the <span
  class="sc">Viverrinae</span>, including the genera <i>Viverra</i>,
  <i>Viverricula</i>, <i>Fossa</i>, <i>Genetta</i>, <i>Prionodon</i>,
  <i>Poiana</i>, <i>Paradoxurus</i>, <i>Arctogale</i>, <i>Hemigale</i>,
  <i>Arctictis</i>, <i>Nandinia</i>, and <i>Cynogale</i>; and the <span
  class="sc">Herpestinae</span>, including the genera <i>Herpestes</i>,
  <i>Helogale</i>, <i>Cynictis</i>, and probably <i>Bdeogale</i> and
  <i>Rhynchogale</i>. In the Viverrinae the digits are always five, the
  claws are more or less retractile, the prescrotal scent glands are
  usually present, and the anus does not open into a sac. On the other
  hand, the Herpestinae are characterised by the non-retractility of the
  claws, the absence of the glands in question, and the fact that the anus
  does open into a terminal sac.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 4. Viverrinae.</b>&mdash;<i>Viverra</i> includes the true
  Civets. The genus, save for one African species, is Oriental in range.
  The molar formula is the complete one for the Viverridae, viz. <!-- Page
  406 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page406"></a>{406}</span>Pm&nbsp;4/4
  M&nbsp;2/2. The secretion of the prescrotal gland of <i>V. civetta</i> yields
  the civet of commerce.</p>

  <p>The "Rasse," genus <i>Viverricula</i>, has been separated generically
  from the true Civets. It is, remarkably enough, common to both
  Madagascar<a name="NtA_268" href="#Nt_268"><sup>[268]</sup></a> and many
  parts of the Oriental region. It is, moreover, capable of climbing trees,
  which its relatives are not. It has no mane like <i>Viverra</i> and is of
  slighter build.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:41%;">
      <a href="images/200.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/200.jpg"

<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 200.&mdash;Civet Cat. <i>Viverra civetta.</i> × <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">6</span>.</p>

  <p><i>Prionodon</i> or <i>Linsang</i> differs from the last two genera in
  the loss of an upper molar. It thus approaches the Cats, with which it
  also agrees in the furry feet. It is a purely Oriental genus. It also
  resembles the Cats in that the claws are apparently quite retractile, a
  feature not common among the group. There are three species of the genus.
  <i>P. pardicolor</i> has large black spots and a ringed tail. Its body is
  some 15 inches in length. Dr. Mivart has commented upon the particularly
  small caecum, which, like that of <i>Arctictis</i>, seems to be on the
  verge of disappearance.</p>

  <p><i>Genetta</i>, including the Genets, is almost purely African. It has
  the full tooth formula of <i>Viverra</i>; but is to be distinguished by
  the absence of a scent pouch, and by a naked strip of skin running up the
  metatarsus. These animals are all brownish yellowish to greyish with
  darker spots. The Common Genet, <i>G. vulgaris</i>, is South European,
  and just gets into Asia; it is also North African. The Genet, an animal
  "with an appetite for petty carnage," is one of those smaller Carnivora
  which are possibly to be regarded as meant by the word <span title="galê" class="grk"
  >&gamma;&alpha;&lambda;&#x1FC6;</span>, and appear to have "functioned"
  as Cats among the Greeks. So recently as <!-- Page 407 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page407"></a>{407}</span>the times of Belon we
  are told (by him) that Genets were common and tame at Constantinople.</p>

  <p><i>Poiana</i>, containing a single African species, a spotted and
  entirely Genet-like animal, has been separated as a distinct genus. Dr.
  Mivart, however, holds it to be a <i>Prionodon</i> which has acquired a
  Genet-like tarsus.</p>

  <p><i>Arctictis</i>, containing but one species, <i>A. binturong</i>, the
  Binturong, is in some ways an exceptional form. It is a black arboreal
  creature of not very wide range in the Oriental region, with a fully
  prehensile tail. This feature and its plantigrade foot with naked sole
  have led to its being regarded as more allied to the Arctoidea. It is,
  however, undoubtedly an ally of <i>Paradoxurus</i>. The caecum is small,
  or may be quite absent. The dentition is I&nbsp;3/3 C&nbsp;1/1 Pm&nbsp;4/3 M&nbsp;2/2. The
  structure of the animal has been investigated by Garrod.<a name="NtA_269"
  href="#Nt_269"><sup>[269]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The genus <i>Fossa</i> is a Viverrine confined to Madagascar. There is
  but one species, <i>F. daubentoni</i>, the "Fossane." It is distinguished
  from <i>Viverra</i> by the presence of two bare spots on the under
  surface of the metatarsus in the hind-limb, and by the absence of a scent
  pouch. The animal is not much spotted and striped, but the striping in
  the young is much more marked.</p>

  <p>Of the genus <i>Paradoxurus</i> there are some ten or a dozen species,
  belonging entirely to the Oriental region. The teeth are as in
  <i>Viverra</i>, but occasionally the molars are reduced to one. The
  pupils are vertical. The tail though long is not prehensile, "but the
  animal appears to have the power of coiling it to some extent, and in
  caged specimens the coiled condition not unfrequently becomes confirmed
  and permanent" (Blanford). This fact accounts for the name
  <i>Paradoxurus</i>; for a prehensile tail is hardly to be expected in an
  animal of the zoological position of the Palm Civets, and yet its
  occasional twisting led originally to the view that it was so. The genus
  has scent glands. The dentition is I&nbsp;3/3 C&nbsp;1/1 Pm&nbsp;4/4 M&nbsp;2/2. <i>P.
  niger</i>, the Indian Palm Civet, is, like other species, not often to be
  seen in a wild condition. It is arboreal, and, like other members of the
  genus, feeds upon a mixed diet, consisting of all kinds of small
  Vertebrata and insects, varied by fruit. Another species, <i>P.
  grayi</i>, is so distinctly vegetarian in its habits that it makes
  considerable havoc in pine-apple beds in the Andaman Islands.</p>

<p><!-- Page 408 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page408"></a>{408}</span></p>

  <p><i>Arctogale</i> is another Oriental genus with very small teeth,
  those of the molar series being hardly in contact. The soles of the feet
  are more naked than in the last genus, and the scent glands, if present,
  appear to be small and ill developed. It has also a long tail, and is
  arboreal in way of life. There is "nothing particular recorded" as to its
  habits. The species are <i>A. leucotis</i> and <i>A. stigmatica</i>.</p>

  <p>Closely allied to both the last genera is <i>Hemigale</i>, also an
  Oriental genus. It is to be distinguished from <i>Paradoxurus</i> by
  having the soles of the feet much less naked, though they are more so
  than in <i>Viverra</i> or <i>Prionodon</i>. The coloration of the
  species, <i>H. hardwicki</i> (a Malayan animal), is very peculiar. The
  body is banded with five or six broad transverse stripes, and the basal
  portion of the tail is also ringed, an uncommon feature in the group. A
  second species of this genus is <i>H. hosei</i>, from Borneo. It is
  blackish in colour, but is not a melanic variety of the last.</p>

  <p><i>Nandinia</i> appears never to possess a caecum.<a name="NtA_270"
  href="#Nt_270"><sup>[270]</sup></a> It is also peculiar among Carnivora
  in the non-ossification of the hinder <!-- Page 409 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page409"></a>{409}</span>part of the bulla. It
  is an African genus, containing two species which are spotted. The tail
  is ringed.</p>

  <p><i>Cynogale</i> is at any rate a partially aquatic, short-tailed,
  web-footed, reddish brown-coloured Civet, which lives upon fish and
  Crustacea, and inhabits the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, and Borneo. It has
  long "moustaches," and is said to have a head bearing a singular
  resemblance to the head of the Insectivorous "Otter" <i>Potamogale</i>.
  The metatarsus is bald, and the pollex and hallux are very well
  developed.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 5. Herpestinae.</b>&mdash;There are over twenty species of
  <i>Herpestes</i> (Mongooses) divided between the Ethiopian and Oriental
  regions, one species, <i>H. ichneumon</i>, being also found in Europe.
  The fur has a "pepper and salt" appearance; the feet are plantigrade.
  There are five fingers and toes. The pollex and hallux are small; the
  tail is long. The tarsus and metatarsus are usually naked. The Egyptian
  species "has been injudiciously denominated the Cat of Pharaoh." It is
  perhaps better known as Pharaoh's Mouse. The beast is so far Cat-like
  that it will destroy Rats and Mice; and it has been exported to sugar
  plantations for that very purpose. More famous are its combats with
  venomous serpents. According to Aristotle and Pliny the Ichneumon first
  coats its body with a coating of mud, in which it wallows, and then with
  this armour can defy the serpent. Topsell tells the tale better. The
  Ichneumon burrows in the sand, and "when the aspe espyeth her threatening
  rage, presently turning about her taile, provoketh the ichneumon to
  combate, and with an open mouth and lofty head doth enter the list, to
  her owne perdition. For the ichneumon being nothing afraid of this great
  bravado, receiveth the encounter, and taking the head of the aspe in his
  mouth biteth that off to prevent the casting out of her poison." In the
  West Indies the animal has been described as fearlessly attacking the
  deadly Fer de Lance and receiving its bites with impunity; it is also
  added that it will eat the leaves of a particular plant as an antidote!
  The real explanation of the result of these encounters is of course the
  agility of the Ichneumon<a name="NtA_271"
  href="#Nt_271"><sup>[271]</sup></a>&mdash;<i>fort cauteleuse beste</i>,
  as Belon says.</p>

  <p>Another species, <i>H. albicauda</i>, is distinguished, as the name
  denotes, by its white tail. A species of this genus, <i>H. urva</i>, <!--
  Page 410 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page410"></a>{410}</span>sometimes raised to generic rank as
  <i>Urva</i>, is partly aquatic in habit; it feeds upon crabs and frogs,
  but is quite willing to take to poultry and their eggs.</p>

  <p><i>Helogale</i> is a genus whose validity appears doubtful (to Dr.
  Mivart). It is African, and contains two species.</p>

  <p><i>Cynictis</i> is an African genus, with five digits on the
  fore-limbs and four on the hind. As in <i>Herpestes</i>, the orbit is
  completely encircled by bone. There is but a single species, <i>C.
  penicillata</i>, which is of a reddish colour and has a bushy tail.</p>

  <p><i>Bdeogale</i>, also African, has the toes still further reduced;
  there are only four on both limbs. The tarsus is hairy and the tail
  bushy. They are "very rare animals, and nothing is known of their
  habits." It is known, however, that they will kill poisonous snakes, for
  Dr. Peters took a Rhinoceros Viper out of the stomach of one.</p>

  <p><i>Rhynchogale</i><a name="NtA_272"
  href="#Nt_272"><sup>[272]</sup></a> differs from all other genera of
  Viverridae, except <i>Crossarchus</i> and <i>Suricata</i>, in having no
  groove upon the muzzle. There are five digits. There is the full
  Viverrine dentition, with five premolars in the upper jaw; but this may
  be an abnormality.<a name="NtA_273"
  href="#Nt_273"><sup>[273]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Crossarchus</i> differs from the last in only having three
  premolars on each side of each jaw. It is also African, and there are
  several species.</p>

  <p><i>Suricata</i> is the last genus of Viverridae; it is also African,
  and contains a single species, <i>Suricata tetradactyla</i>, the
  "Meerkat" of the Cape. The Suricate has but four toes on each foot; the
  tarsus and the metatarsus are naked below. The body is banded
  posteriorly. There are fifteen dorsal vertebrae, and the orbit is <!--
  Page 411 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page411"></a>{411}</span>closed by bone. The Suricate lives in
  caves and rock crevices, and will dig burrows. It is distinctly a diurnal
  animal, and sits upon its hind-legs after the fashion of a Marmot. As
  Buffon noticed in a tame specimen (thought by him to be a native of
  Surinam), the animal barks like a dog. The Suricate is largely
  vegetarian, living upon roots.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Hyaenidae.</b>&mdash;Unlike though the Hyaenas appear to be
  to the last family&mdash;mainly perhaps on account of size&mdash;they
  are, nevertheless, very nearly akin to them, more so than to the Cat
  tribe. It will be remembered that the striping and spotting of the
  Hyaenas is very Genet- and Suricate-like.</p>

  <p>There are admittedly two genera among the Hyaenidae, <i>Hyaena</i>
  itself with three species,<a name="NtA_274"
  href="#Nt_274"><sup>[274]</sup></a> and the Aard Wolf, <i>Proteles</i>,
  with but one. But Dr. Mivart considers that the Spotted Hyaena should
  form a genus apart, <i>Crocuta</i>&mdash;a proceeding which was initiated
  by the late Dr. Gray of the British Museum. The Hyaenidae are to be
  distinguished by the following characters<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span>There are generally four toes, always so in the
  hind-foot. The claws are non-retractile. The nose and upper lip are
  grooved. The molar formula is Pm&nbsp;4/3 M&nbsp;1/1. The soles of the feet are
  covered with hairs upon the tarsus and metatarsus. No scent glands. Tail
  short. Dorsal vertebrae more numerous than in other Aeluroids,
  <i>i.e.</i> fifteen. The bulla is divided by a rudimentary septum
  only.</p>

  <p>The Hyaenas, stigmatised by Sir Samuel Baker as "low-caste creatures,"
  are mainly carrion feeders. Much Arab superstition is associated with
  them. Certain peculiarities in the structure <!-- Page 413 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page413"></a>{413}</span>of the organs of
  reproduction have led to the belief that a Hyaena changes its sex every
  year. Its almost human-sounding howls are supposed to be a deliberate
  trap for the unwary traveller. There is also a legend that in the eye of
  the Hyaena is a stone which if placed under the tongue of a man endows
  him with the gift of prophecy.</p>

  <p><i>Proteles</i> presents many resemblances to the Hyaenas, but also
  certain differences; by many it is placed in a separate family. There is
  but one species, <i>P. cristata</i>, the Aard Wolf of South Africa. In
  outward aspect it is very Hyaena-like, the coat being striped, and the
  ears, though longer, resembling those of a Hyaena. There is also a mane.
  There are, however, five toes on the fore-feet. The teeth are feebler,
  particularly the molars, which are also reduced in number. The skull, as
  in <i>Hyaena</i>, has no alisphenoid canal, but the bulla tympani is
  divided by a septum. The animal seems to feed largely upon insects,
  particularly Termites, and also upon carrion.<a name="NtA_275"
  href="#Nt_275"><sup>[275]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Of extinct Hyaenoids <i>Ictitherium</i> seems to be transitional
  between them and the Viverridae. Its dentition, 3/3, 1/1, 4/3, 2/1, is
  that of a Viverrid, and the feet are five-toed. The upper carnassial
  tooth, however, is like that of <i>Hyaena</i> in having a strong inner
  cusp. Other extinct genera of Hyaenas are <i>Lycyaena</i> and
  <i>Hyaenictis</i>. The genus <i>Hyaena</i> itself goes back as far as to
  the Miocene, and occurred in Europe until the Pleistocene. The Cave
  Hyaena of this country seems to be indistinguishable from <i>Crocuta
  maculata</i>, though it has received the name of <i>H. spelaea</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 5. Canidae.</b><a name="NtA_276"
  href="#Nt_276"><sup>[276]</sup></a>&mdash;This family cannot be divided
  into more than five genera, and is universally distributed with the
  exception of New Zealand. The auditory bulla is smooth and rounded, and
  has internally a very incomplete septum, extending through about
  one-fourth or one-third of the cavity. The meatus has a fairly prominent
  under lip. The paroccipital process is long and prominent. The mastoid is
  distinct, though but slightly developed. The glenoid foramen is large;
  the condyloid foramen is conspicuous, and the carotid canal is deep
  within the foramen lacerum posterius. The last three characters are
  Bear-like; the <!-- Page 414 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>All the Dogs have a caecum<a name="NtA_277"
  href="#Nt_277"><sup>[277]</sup></a> of simple cylindrical form. In <i>C.
  cancrivorus</i>, <i>C. jubatus</i>, and <i>Nyctereutes procyonides</i>
  this organ is straight or only very faintly curved; in other Dogs it is
  coiled into an <img src="images/s.png" class="middle" style="height:2ex;" alt="S"
  />-like form, sometimes with an additional twist. The Dogs have, as a
  rule, five toes, one being dropped in <i>Lycaon</i>. The tail is fairly
  long and distinctly bushy. There is in a number of species a gland at the
  root of the tail, the presence of which can frequently be detected by the
  wet appearance due to the oozing secretion. The great majority of
  existing Canidae belong to the genus <i>Canis</i>. But certainly three,
  and more doubtfully four, other genera can be distinguished.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Icticyon</i> contains but one recent species, the Bush
  Dog (<i>I. venaticus</i>, Lund) of British Guiana. The animal has a
  somewhat Paradoxure-like, at any rate a distinctly un-dog-like, aspect,
  being longish in the body (some 2 feet long), shortish in the legs, and
  big-headed. It is blackish in colour, verging towards golden brown on the
  head and back. Sir W. Flower, to whom we owe our chief knowledge of its
  structure, characterises it as like a young Fox, and with the playful
  manners of a puppy. The animal appears to hunt in packs and by scent, and
  has a reputation for ferocity. <i>Icticyon</i> differs from <i>Canis</i>
  and agrees with the Indian <i>Cuon</i> in having but forty teeth, the
  last molar having disappeared from the upper and lower jaws. The caecum,
  unlike that of the majority of Canidae, is only slightly curved. The
  brain, oddly enough, shows a Cat-like peculiarity. It has been pointed
  out that in their long bodies and short legs the genera <i>Cuon</i> and
  <i>Icticyon</i> resemble the primitive dogs.<a name="NtA_278"
  href="#Nt_278"><sup>[278]</sup></a></p>

  <p>A genus <i>Nyctereutes</i> is usually separated from <i>Canis</i> for
  the inclusion of <i>N. procyonides</i> only. The separation is based upon
  <!-- Page 415 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page415"></a>{415}</span>the strikingly unusual coloration of this
  Dog. It is a small animal, with numerous long white hairs dorsally. The
  face, chest, and much of the belly are black. Its aspect distinctly
  recalls that of a Raccoon,<a name="NtA_279"
  href="#Nt_279"><sup>[279]</sup></a> especially in the black patches below
  the eyes, whence of course the scientific name and the pseudo-vernacular
  "Raccoon-like Dog." It inhabits China and Japan. As to structure, there
  is hardly anything that justifies its exclusion from the genus
  <i>Canis</i>. Garrod, however, mentions the unusually large size of the
  Spigelian lobe of the liver.</p>

  <p>Wortman and Malkens<a name="NtA_280"
  href="#Nt_280"><sup>[280]</sup></a> have instituted a genus
  <i>Nothocyon</i> for Dr. Mivart's species <i>C. urostictus</i><a
  name="NtA_281" href="#Nt_281"><sup>[281]</sup></a> and <i>C.
  parvidens</i>, which are both South American forms.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Otocyon</i> contains but one species, <i>O.
  megalotis</i>, an African species, ranging pretty widely in that
  continent (from the Cape to Somaliland, in sandy districts), and
  sometimes confused with the Fennec on account of its long ears. Its
  principal structural difference from other Dogs is that there is an
  additional molar in each jaw, the molar formula being thus M&nbsp;3/4 or even
  4/4. Moreover the carnassial teeth are not so pronounced, and Professor
  Huxley laid especial stress upon the <!-- Page 416 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page416"></a>{416}</span>likeness of some of the
  cheek teeth to those of the more primitive Arctoids. The angle of the
  lower jaw is inflected, a character, however, which seems to be more
  general than is usually allowed among animals not referable to the
  Marsupials. It is possible that <i>Otocyon</i> is a persistent
  Creodont-like form which has developed in a direction curiously, and in a
  most detailed fashion, parallel to the Dogs. If, however, we may assume
  the addition of the molar, then this anomalous but not necessarily
  untenable conclusion is obviated.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Cuon</i>, or <i>Cyon</i>, has been instituted for the two
  or three species of Eastern Dogs (<i>C. primaevus</i>, <i>C.
  dukkunensis</i>, etc.) which agree with each other in the constant loss
  of a molar in the lower jaw, or, it should be said, almost constant loss,
  for the missing tooth is occasionally represented. The latter of the two
  species mentioned, the Dhole, is, like its congeners, an animal which
  hunts in packs; it is said to hunt even the ferocious Tiger, and to be
  thus one of the few animals which can face the largest and fiercest of
  the Carnivora.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Lycaon</i> is a very distinct type, being differentiated
  from other Dogs by the possession of only four toes on both fore- and
  hind-limbs, and by the dental formula, which is Pm&nbsp;4/4 M&nbsp;2/3. The one
  species is <i>L. pictus</i>, the Cape Hunting Dog. It is singularly like
  a Hyaena<a name="NtA_282" href="#Nt_282"><sup>[282]</sup></a> in general
  appearance; the ochraceous grey ground-colour with black markings and the
  long ears produce this likeness. The animal has got its vernacular name
  from the habit of hunting in packs. Its range is over a good part of
  Africa. The occurrence of this species (or at least genus, for the name
  <i>L. anglicus</i> has been used) in caves in Glamorganshire seems to
  show that it is a comparatively recent immigrant into Africa. As to its
  visceral structures, <i>Lycaon</i><a name="NtA_283"
  href="#Nt_283"><sup>[283]</sup></a> does not differ widely from other
  Dogs. It has, however, no lytta beneath the tongue. The intestines are
  thus divided: large, 9 feet 1 inch; small, 1 foot 3 inches. This
  contrasts with the proportions observable in some other Dogs. While other
  Dogs have but a cartilaginous rudiment of the clavicle, <i>Lycaon</i> has
  a considerably larger representative of this bone.</p>

  <p>The bulk of the Dogs, Wolves, Foxes, and Jackals are thus left over
  for inclusion in the genus <i>Canis</i>. But the numerous <!-- Page 417
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page417"></a>{417}</span>members of
  this genus can, according to Professor Huxley, be sorted into two series
  by certain cranial characters. The two series he termed the "Alopecoid"
  or Fox-like, and the "Thooid" or Wolf-like. It was suggested that the
  generic name <i>Vulpes</i> be used for the former, and <i>Canis</i> for
  the second. The characters which will be dealt with immediately are also
  to be noted among <!-- Page 418 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page418"></a>{418}</span>the Dogs belonging to genera that have
  already been separated off. Thus <i>Lycaon</i> is distinctly Thooid. The
  characters in question are these<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span>In the
  Fox series, the frontal air-sinus of the Thooids is absent; the cranial
  cavity is pear-shaped, without an abrupt angle coinciding with the
  supra-orbital sulcus, such as exists in the other group; the coronoid
  process of the mandible is rather higher and more turned back in the
  Foxes, while the depth of the mandible at the level of the first molar is
  greater.</p>

<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 209.&mdash;Japanese Wolf. <i>Canis hodophylax.</i> × &#x215B; (From <i>Nature</i>.)</p>

  (Arctic Fox), <i>C. zerda</i> (the Fennec), <i>C. chama</i> (the
  Silver-backed Fox of Africa), <i>C. virginianus</i> (the Virginian Fox),

  country. On the other hand, the Dogs proper (such as <i>C. dingo</i>),
  the Wolves (<i>C. lupus</i>, <i>C. pallipes</i>, <i>C. niger</i>), the
  Japanese Wolf (<i>C. hodophylax</i>), the Red Wolf of America (<i>C.
  jubatus</i>), the Jackals (<i>C. aureus</i>, <i>C. anthus</i>, etc.), the
  Prairie Wolf (<i>C. latrans</i>), and a number of American forms, such as
  <i>C. azarae</i>, its close ally <i>C. cancrivorus</i> ( = <i>C.
  rudis</i>), <i>C. antarcticus</i>, <i>C. magellanicus</i>, etc., are
  decidedly Wolves rather than Foxes. <!-- Page 419 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page419"></a>{419}</span></p>

  <p>The Arctic Fox, <i>Canis lagopus</i>, is known by its bluish summer
  and pure white winter dress as "Blue Fox" and "White Fox" respectively.
  It is an inhabitant of the Arctic north; but in former days, as its
  remains show, it descended to such southern latitudes as Germany and this
  country. The most southern point which it now inhabits is Iceland. This
  small Fox is well known as being one of the few animals which change
  their dress to a complete white in winter. This change is, however, not
  absolutely universal; and M. Trouessart has even stated that the supposed
  change does not exist, but that the colours are a question of age and
  sex. This Fox feeds on birds and cast-up carcases of Whales and Seals; it
  is also said to devour shell-fish, and actually to store up food when
  abundant for seasons of scarcity. A Fox has been observed to "carry off
  eggs in his mouth from an eider duck's nest, one at a time, until the
  whole were removed"; and in winter to "scratch a hole down through very
  deep snow to a <i>cache</i> of eggs beneath." These anecdotes are told by
  Sir Leopold M&lsquo;Clintock; but others have also asserted the storing
  habits of this Fox, which really has only a short time of the year in
  which it can catch suitable living food.</p>

  <p><i>Canis vulpes</i>, the Fox, is not only a native of England, but
  extends as far to the east as Egypt, the so-called <i>C. aegyptiacus</i>
  being at most a mere variety. Varieties indeed occur in these islands;
  the English Fox being redder, the Scotch greyer. Not only is the Fox a
  truly indigenous English beast, but its remains go back a very long way
  into past time. Its bones occur in the Red Crag, a deposit of Pliocene
  times. Its prevalence now is no doubt due to its preservation as a beast
  of chase. It lives in burrows, either excavating them itself or taking
  possession of those of some other animal; the Badger suffers in this way,
  and is said to be vanquished not by the teeth of the burglarious Fox, but
  by its far fouler habits! It is curious that the expression "foxing" is
  not so suitable to this animal as to many others. The habit of "shamming
  death" is a widely-spread one in the animal world, but at least not
  common with our Fox. The sagacity of the Fox appears to be a little more
  proverbial than actual; literature teems with its accomplishments. The
  worthy Archbishop of Upsala, Olaus Magnus, figured Foxes dipping their
  tails in the streams, and then pulling out inquisitive crayfishes <!--
  Page 420 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page420"></a>{420}</span>which
  had seized upon them. "It is a crafty, lively, and libidinous creature,"
  observed a writer of the last century.</p>

  <p>Of Jackals there are many species, both African and Oriental. Mr. de
  Winton allows the following list of African species<a name="NtA_284"
  href="#Nt_284"><sup>[284]</sup></a><span class="nw">:&mdash;</span><i>C.
  anthus</i>, <i>C. variegatus</i>, <i>C. mesomelas</i>, <i>C.
  lateralis</i>. <i>C. mesomelas</i> is distinguished by the broad black
  patch in the middle of the back. These animals do not appear to go in
  packs as so many Canidae do; they live upon carrion, but also rob
  hen-roosts, and commit other depredations upon the live stock of farmers.
  The "Quaha," <i>C. lateralis</i>, is distinguished from the last by its
  sharp bark, and by the obvious side stripe which has given to it its
  name. It is curious that it should live in apparent amity with <i>C.
  mesomelas</i>, since the habits of the two are identical and would lead,
  one might suppose, to a severe struggle for existence, in which one of
  the two would disappear. Of Indian Jackals <i>C. aureus</i> is the most
  familiar type.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:43%;">

  </div>
<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 210.&mdash;Wolf. <i>Canis lupus.</i> × &#x215B;.</p>

  <p>The European Wolf, <i>Canis lupus</i>, was once, but is no longer, an
  inhabitant of the British Islands. Their former prevalence is indicated
  by many names of towns and villages, such as Ulceby and Usselby in
  Lincolnshire, the town of Wolverton, and Woolmer Forest. In Saxon times
  Wolves were very abundant; and even so recently as the reign of Elizabeth
  they were to be seen on <!-- Page 421 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page421"></a>{421}</span>Dartmoor and in the Forest of Dean. In the
  New Forest they were hunted in the twelfth century. It would seem that
  the last English Wolf was slain some time during the reign of Henry VII.
  In Scotland, however, they persisted very much longer. So recently as
  1743 was the last killed. But before this period they had begun to get
  exceedingly scarce, for the price of a skin in 1620 is quoted at £6:13:4.
  In Ireland Wolves lingered yet longer; about 1770 is believed to be the
  date of their final extinction in that island. The Wolf nowadays is
  distributed over the greater part of Europe, Northern Asia, and North
  America, the American form not being considered to be distinct from its
  European ally. Much legend has collected round this fierce Carnivore.
  Aristotle, usually accurate in the main, still "states more of wolves
  than experience warranted." Pliny, unable to sift truth from falsehood,
  was in this matter "an eager listener to all old women's tales." Aelian
  added to his marvels and asserted that the Wolf cannot bend its head
  back; if it should happen to tread on the flower of the squill it at once
  becomes torpid. So the wily fox, fearing his more powerful enemy, takes
  care to strew his path with squills! The conversion of men into Wolves
  was a well-known superstition, dating from Grecian and Roman times; it
  formed the basis of much of the witchcraft persecutions of the Middle
  Ages and onwards, and has left its mark in folklore, <i>e.g.</i> the Wolf
  in "Red Riding Hood."</p>

  <p>The Indian Wolves, <i>C. pallipes</i>, <i>C. chanco</i>, and <i>C.
  laniger</i>, are hardly, if at all, different from <i>C. lupus</i>.
  Professor Huxley has remarked upon the likeness of <i>C. pallipes</i> to
  a Jackal, thus bridging over the very inconsiderable gap that may be held
  to divide Jackals and Wolves.</p>

  <p>The Dingo, <i>Canis dingo</i>, is an interesting and somewhat
  mysterious species of Dog or Wolf. As is well known, it is an Australian
  species; but it does not seem to be certain whether it was tamed and
  brought over to Australia by the native races, or is a true and
  indigenous Australian species.</p>

  <p>The colour of this species varies, but is usually of a reddish brown;
  it is, however, often grey and indeed almost black. Whether indigenous or
  introduced, the Dingo is a plague to Australian settlers, devouring
  Sheep, which it generally destroys by tearing out the paunch. It does not
  as a rule hunt in packs. The Dingo is stated to feign death with so much
  persistence that <!-- Page 422 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page422"></a>{422}</span>an individual has been known to be partly
  flayed before moving. Dingo remains have been found in river-gravels in
  Australia where no human remains have been detected. This argues for its
  indigeneity; but, on the other hand, it has been pointed out that man
  himself in the Australian continent goes back a very long way into time,
  and may thus still have imported this companion with him. Anyhow it is
  quite a wild creature now. Dr. Nehring, an expert investigator into the
  subject of domestic animals, has stated that the skeleton of the Dingo
  does not suggest a feral animal at all but a purely wild race.</p>

  <p>The Domestic Dog is usually spoken of as <i>Canis familiaris</i>; but
  to remains in bone caverns the name of <i>C. ferus</i> or <i>C. mikii</i>
  has been given. There seems to be no doubt that the Dog was the "friend
  of man" in very early times. Its remains have been met with in Danish
  kitchen-middens, in the lake-dwellings of the Swiss lakes, and during the
  Bronze Age in Europe generally. But "there are few more vexed questions
  in the archaeology of natural history than the origin of the dog." Its
  remains already referred to may in many cases have argued its use as
  food. But in a Neolithic barrow a Dog was found buried with a woman, the
  <!-- Page 423 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page423"></a>{423}</span>skeletons of both being <i>in situ</i>;
  this animal was about the size of a Shepherd Dog. The actual Dog of
  to-day is divisible into more than 180 different breeds; but in a work
  upon "Natural History" it would seem out of place to enumerate and
  characterise these artificial products. Authors vary in their opinion as
  to what stock gave rise to the domestic races of the past and of to-day.
  The Jackal, the Bunasu (<i>C. primaevus</i>), the Indian Wolf (<i>C.
  pallipes</i>), have been proposed as likely ancestors. It is more
  probable that there is much admixture, and that various wild types have
  been selected by man in various countries.</p>

  <p><b>Extinct Canidae.</b>&mdash;Many of the existing species of Canidae
  are also to be found in Pleistocene deposits of the countries which they
  now inhabit. A few show a wider range in the immediate past than in the
  present. Thus <i>Lycaon</i> (<i>L. anglicus</i>) has been met with in
  caves in Glamorganshire, while <i>Icticyon</i> of South America appears
  to be congeneric with <i>Speothos</i> of the Brazilian caves. The African
  <i>Otocyon</i> seems to occur in deposits in India. There are also
  numerous extinct species belonging to the genus <i>Canis</i>, which
  extend as far back as the Pliocene.</p>

  <p>The earlier types of Dogs have been placed in different genera.
  <i>Cynodictis</i> is an Eocene form from European strata. The skull is
  decidedly Civet-like, with a short snout. The fore- and hind-feet were
  five-toed, with well-developed pollex and hallux. The dentition was that
  of modern Dogs, the molars being two in the upper and three in the lower
  jaw. The general aspect of the creature and the form of the skeleton was
  much like that of the Viverrine genus <i>Paradoxurus</i>, of which, as
  well as of the Dogs, <i>Cynodictis</i> might have been an ancestor.</p>

  <p><i>Simocyon</i> of the Upper Miocene serves as the type of a separate
  sub-family of Dogs, Simocyoninae. The skull is short, broad, and high;
  the shortening of the skull affecting the jaws has reduced the teeth
  greatly; the first three premolars are very small, fall out soon, and are
  thus often deficient. There are only two molars in each jaw. This type is
  of course nowhere near the ancestral Dog. It is a much-specialised branch
  of an early type. <i>Cephalogale</i> is less specialised; there are the
  usual four premolars. <i>Enhydrocyon</i> is an intermediate form; it has
  lost one premolar in each jaw.</p>

  <p><i>Amphicyon</i>, forming the type of another sub-family,
  Amphicyoninae, though usually placed among the Dogs, presents us with
  <!-- Page 424 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page424"></a>{424}</span>many Bear-like features in its
  organisation. The feet, for instance, were plantigrade and five-toed. The
  ulna and the radius are specially compared with the same bones in the
  Bear tribe. The skull on the other hand is as distinctly Dog-like in
  form. The molars are large, broad, and crushing, and Bear-like. The
  largest known species, <i>A. giganteus</i>, is of about the size of the
  Brown Bear. <i>Amphicyon</i> is a Miocene genus. Eocene and allied to it
  is <i>Pseudamphicyon</i>. This genus has, like <i>Amphicyon</i>, the
  complete dentition of forty-four teeth. In the Amphicyoninae generally
  the feet are five-toed, the humerus has an entepicondylar foramen and the
  femur a third trochanter. The upper molars are large.</p>

  <p>The closely allied and American genus <i>Daphaenus</i> has also
  plantigrade feet, and has in its structure many reminiscences of the
  Creodonts. So, too, has the Eocene <i>Uintacyon</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Cynodesmus</i> is closely allied to <i>Cynodictis</i>. It has
  ancient features combined with quite modern ones. The skull is described
  as being Creodont-like, but the dentition is that of the microdont modern
  Dogs. In accordance with its age the cerebral convolutions of this Dog
  are much simpler than in existing Dogs, and the hemispheres do not cover
  the cerebellum so much.</p>

  <p><b>The Bear-like Carnivora or Arctoidea.</b>&mdash;That division of
  the Carnivora which is typically represented by the Bears embraces three
  recent families, which are united by a number of characters. These
  Carnivora are always plantigrade or nearly so. They have nearly always
  five toes. The claws are not retractile, or at most semi-retractile as in
  the Panda. In the skull the tympanic bulla is often depressed, and is not
  so globular and obvious as in the Cats. Its cavity is not divided by a
  septum. The paroccipital processes are not applied to it. The carnassial
  tooth is less emphasised in this group than in the Cats.</p>

  <p>These characters, however, have to be used with caution, as they are
  hardly universally applicable. A fairly typical Arctoid bulla is seen in
  such a form as <i>Cercoleptes</i>. The bulla itself is a little more
  swollen than in <i>Ursus</i>, but it is flattened off in the same way
  towards the bony meatus. The paroccipital processes, slightly developed,
  are at a distance of ¼-inch from the posterior margin of the bulla. In
  the Raccoon the bullae are much more swollen, and the paroccipital
  processes are closer to them. In the Marbled Polecat, <i>Putorius
  sarmaticus</i>, the bullae are fairly <!-- Page 425 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page425"></a>{425}</span>swollen, and there is
  but little flattening towards the meatus: the paroccipital processes,
  though slight, are in contact with the bullae basally, though their free
  tips are turned away from them. Finally, in <i>Ictonyx</i> the bullae are
  much swollen; there is but little flattening towards the meatus, and the
  paroccipital processes, themselves much swollen, are pressed closely
  against the bullae. The Mustelidae, therefore, in this as in other
  characters, approach the Aeluroids.</p>

  <p>There is no caecum, a feature which marks off the Arctoidea from all
  Carnivora except the Viverrids <i>Nandinia</i> and <i>Arctictis</i>
  (occasionally). The brain is characterised by the possession of what Dr.
  Mivart has described as the "ursine lozenge," a tract about the middle of
  the hemispheres, defined posteriorly by the crucial sulcus, and formed by
  the emergence on to the surface of the brain of the hippocampal
  gyrus.</p>

  <p>The Arctoidea are very widely distributed. But there are some curious
  exceptions. Thus there are no representatives of the group (as might be
  expected) in the Australian region; they are completely absent from
  Madagascar; while the true Bears (family Ursidae) are totally absent from
  Ethiopian Africa, and are only represented by a single species, <i>Ursus
  ornatus</i>, in the Neotropical region.</p>

  <p>It is noteworthy that the Arctoidea never show spots or <!-- Page 426
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page426"></a>{426}</span>cross stripes
  (save rings on the tail), which are so common a feature of the coloration
  of the Cat-like forms.</p>

  <p>In bracketing together the three families which are described in the
  following pages, emphasis is laid upon a number of undoubtedly common
  features. Palaeontology seems, however, to suggest that the Mustelidae
  come nearer to the Viverridae. That the Bears and Dogs are connected by
  extinct annectent genera does not interfere with their present
  distinctness.</p>

  <p>The systematic arrangement of these Carnivora is not easy. It may be
  useful, however, to give a method of arrangement for the convenient
  placing of the genera.</p>

  <p>The most primitive group is perhaps that of the true Bears, family
  Ursidae; for in them the molars are two above and three below, and have
  thus not become diminished in number as in some of the other members of
  the order. Moreover, the Bears have lobate kidneys, which character,
  often occurring in the young of animals which when adult have smooth
  kidneys, may be looked upon as a primitive character. The feet
  furthermore are completely plantigrade. This family will contain only
  three genera, <i>Ursus</i>, <i>Melursus</i>, and <i>Aeluropus</i>.</p>

  <p>Next comes the family Procyonidae, in several members of which one
  molar is lost below, though in others the more archaic formula is
  retained. The kidneys are simple. This family contains the American
  genera <i>Procyon</i>, <i>Nasua</i>, <i>Bassariscus</i>,
  <i>Bassaricyon</i>, <i>Cercoleptes</i>, and the Old-World form
  <i>Aelurus</i>.</p>

  <p>The third family, Mustelidae, has the molar formula reduced to 1/2 or
  1/1. The kidneys are simple except in the Otters. To this family are
  assigned the following genera<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span><i>Arctonyx</i>, <i>Conepatus</i>,
  <i>Meles</i>, <i>Mephitis</i>, <i>Taxidea</i>, <i>Mydaus</i>,
  <i>Mellivora</i>, <i>Helictis</i>, <i>Ictonyx</i>, <i>Mustela</i>,
  <i>Galictis</i>, <i>Grisonia</i>, <i>Putorius</i>, <i>Gulo</i>, and the
  aquatic <i>Lutra</i>, <i>Enhydris</i>, and <i>Aonyx</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 6. Procyonidae.</b>&mdash;This family is mainly American in
  range, the genus <i>Aelurus</i> alone being a native of the Old World.
  But Zittel would include with the genera of this family the Viverrine and
  Oriental genus <i>Arctictis</i>, a proceeding which is perhaps hardly
  admissible, though the occasional absence of a caecum in that animal is
  so far in favour of such an alliance. The largely vegetable nature of its
  food and its arboreal habits cause a certain amount of likeness to some
  of the members of the present group of Carnivores. The Procyonidae have
  two <!-- Page 427 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page427"></a>{427}</span>molars in either half of each jaw. The
  carnassial teeth are not typically developed, and the molars are broad
  and tuberculate. The tail is long, often prehensile, and often ringed in
  the disposition of its colour pattern. The alisphenoid canal is absent
  save in the aberrant <i>Aelurus</i>. Both condyloid and postglenoid
  foramina are present. The members of this family are plantigrade.</p>

<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 213.&mdash;Raccoon. <i>Procyon lotor.</i> × <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">5</span>.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Procyon</i> includes at least two species of Raccoon, the
  northern form, <i>P. lotor</i>, and the South American, <i>P.
  cancrivorus</i>. To these may possibly be added a third, <i>P.
  nigripes</i>. This genus is characterised by the length and the mobility
  of the fingers, and indeed it uses its hands greatly. It has no median
  groove upon the muzzle, which is found in many other Arctoids; the ears
  are moderately large; the tail is not long, being about one-third of the
  entire length of the animal, including the tail. The soles of the feet
  are naked. Its limbs are very long (for an Arctoid), and this gives to
  the animal a bunched-up appearance when walking. There are four premolars
  and two molars on each side of each jaw. There are fourteen pairs of
  ribs, of which ten pairs reach the sternum. The latter is composed of
  nine pieces.</p>

  <p>The first-named species has received its name from the fact&mdash;of
  which there is abundant proof&mdash;that it dips its food into water. As
  a matter of fact, the animal frequents the margins of streams, and hunts
  in the shallow water beneath stones for <!-- Page 428 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page428"></a>{428}</span>crayfish, and it also
  captures fish. Not only is this animal partially aquatic, but it can
  climb well&mdash;"they make their homes in trees, but carry on their
  business elsewhere." The animal can be readily tamed, but is a tiresome
  pet on account of its insatiable curiosity and its skill in the use of
  its hands, which enables it to unlatch doors and generally to pry about
  everywhere. The Raccoons are mostly nocturnal creatures.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Bassaricyon</i><a name="NtA_285"
  href="#Nt_285"><sup>[285]</sup></a> includes two species, both American,
  <i>B. alleni</i> being from Ecuador, and <i>B. gabbii</i> from Costa
  Rica. They have so much the aspect of a Kinkajou that a specimen, which
  arrived at the Zoological Gardens, was presented and entered as one of
  those animals. Nevertheless there are many differences between the two
  genera. The tail of <i>Bassaricyon</i> is not prehensile, and the animal,
  as will be seen from Fig. 214, has a sharper snout; the brain is more
  like that of <i>Bassariscus</i>. The likeness to <i>Cercoleptes</i> can
  hardly perhaps be regarded as an example of "mimicry" since the forms are
  so nearly related, and the advantage of such an imitation remains to be
  proved. The muzzle of <i>Bassaricyon</i> is grooved; the ears are fairly
  large; the soles of the feet are naked; there is but a single pair of
  teats. There are two molars and four premolars to each half jaw.</p>

  <p>The dorsal vertebrae are thirteen in number; nine of the ribs reach
  the sternum. The slenderness and convexity of the lower margin of the
  lower jaw, as well as the feeble angular process, distinguish this genus
  from its undoubtedly near ally <i>Cercoleptes</i>. The dental formula
  also is different.</p>

  <p><i>Bassariscus</i> has a ringed tail like a Raccoon, and is also
  American in range; it furthermore agrees with the Raccoon in <!-- Page
  429 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page429"></a>{429}</span>being
  nocturnal and mainly arboreal in habit. There are apparently three
  species, of which <i>B. astutus</i> is the best known, having been on
  several occasions exhibited at the Zoological Society's Gardens, the last
  examples so lately as 1900. The animal was for a long time believed to be
  allied to the Oriental Paradoxures, and its occurrence in America was
  therefore puzzling. The real affinities of the creature were, however,
  definitely set at rest by Sir W. Flower, and later accounts of its
  anatomy have confirmed this opinion.<a name="NtA_286"
  href="#Nt_286"><sup>[286]</sup></a> The vertebrae are more numerous than
  in <i>Procyon</i>, and the teeth are slightly different; otherwise it
  presents many likenesses to its nearest ally. The ears are long; the nose
  is grooved; and the palms and soles are naked.</p>

  <p>The Kinkajou, <i>Cercoleptes</i>, is likewise an American Arctoid. It
  ranges from Central Mexico down to the Rio Negro in Brazil. It was at one
  time confounded, and, considering its external appearance, not
  unnaturally, with the Lemurs. Sir R. Owen dispelled this view by a
  careful dissection of the creature. Nevertheless, there are certain
  anatomical features in which it differs <!-- Page 430 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page430"></a>{430}</span>from Carnivora and
  resembles Lemuroids.<a name="NtA_287" href="#Nt_287"><sup>[287]</sup></a>
  It has been pointed out that the form of the lower jaw "much resembles
  that of the Lemuroid <i>Microrhynchus</i>." There is, however, no doubt
  that it is rightly placed in the present group. The tail is very
  prehensile, and the animal is therefore, as might be supposed from this
  circumstance, purely arboreal. It has some twenty-eight vertebrae. This
  genus has a median groove upon the nose. The claws are long and sharply
  pointed, and the palms and soles of the feet are naked. The premolars are
  three, the molars two. There are fourteen dorsal vertebrae, of which nine
  are united to the nine-jointed sternum by ribs. There is but one species,
  <i>C. caudivolvulus</i>, of a uniform yellowish-brown colour.</p>

  <p><i>Nasua</i>, the Coati, ranges from Texas to Paraguay, and has two
  species. In Guatemala it reaches a height of 9000 feet on the mountains.
  The nose is produced into a short and very <!-- Page 431 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page431"></a>{431}</span>mobile proboscis, hence
  its name. The native Mexican name for the creature is "Quanhpecotl."</p>

  <p>The Coati is largely arboreal, and hunts iguanas in large bands, some
  of them being on the trees and some on the ground beneath. It also grubs
  up worms and larvae, for which purpose its long snout is suited. The
  molars of the genus resemble those of <i>Procyon</i>.</p>

  <p>There is not a median groove upon the nose. The palms and soles are
  naked. Six teats occur. There are thirteen dorsal vertebrae. <i>Nasua
  nasica</i><a name="NtA_288" href="#Nt_288"><sup>[288]</sup></a> and <i>N.
  rufa</i> are the best known and perhaps the only species. The colour of
  the fur varies a good deal, and has led to the use of other names for
  supposed species.</p>

  <p><i>Aelurus</i>, the Panda, is a largish animal found in the
  south-eastern Himalayas up to a height of 12,000 feet. It has a glossy
  fur of a reddish colour, and a "white somewhat cat-like face." The molar
  formula which distinguishes it from the New-World Arctoids belonging to
  the Procyonidae, as well as from its possible ally <i>Aeluropus</i>, is
  Pm&nbsp;3/4 M&nbsp;2/2. The anatomy of the animal has been described by Sir W.
  Flower.<a name="NtA_289" href="#Nt_289"><sup>[289]</sup></a> Dr. Mivart
  has pointed out that the muzzle though short is upturned in a way
  distinctly recalling that of <i>Nasua</i>. The animal inhabits forests,
  and feeds almost entirely upon vegetable food. It eats eggs, however, and
  insects. Though living to a great extent upon the ground, it is also
  arboreal, and has sharp semi-retractile claws. It is said to be dull of
  sight, hearing, and smell, and yet with these disadvantages is also
  unprovided with cunning or ferocity. Its habits have been compared with
  those of a Kinkajou.</p>

  <p><b>Fossil Procyonidae.</b>&mdash;In addition to several of the
  existing genera, the remains are known of various extinct forms of
  Procyonidae. <i>Leptarctus</i>, with one species, <i>L. primaevus</i>, is
  of Pliocene age, but is known only by one ramus of the lower jaw. It
  appears to "offer a number of transitional characters between the more
  typical Procyonidae and the aberrant <i>Cercoleptes</i>."<a
  name="NtA_290" href="#Nt_290"><sup>[290]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Fam. 7. Mustelidae.</b>&mdash;Contrary to what has been stated with
  regard to the habits of the Procyonidae, the Mustelidae are for the most
  part "bloodthirsty robbers," and are spread over the <!-- Page 432
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page432"></a>{432}</span>whole surface
  of the world, with the exception of Australia and Madagascar. The molar
  teeth are generally reduced to one in the upper jaw, and sometimes to one
  in the lower jaw, which thus gives "a sort of <i>prima facie</i>
  resemblance to the feline dentition." There is no alisphenoid canal;
  postglenoid and condyloid foramina are found.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 1. Melinae.</b>&mdash;Of this sub-family there are
  representatives both in the Old and New Worlds.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:41%;">

<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 218.&mdash;Badger. <i>Meles taxus.</i> × <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">6</span>.</p>

  <p><i>Meles</i>, the Badger, is exclusively Palaearctic in range.<a
  name="NtA_291" href="#Nt_291"><sup>[291]</sup></a> Dr. Mivart says that
  <i>Meles</i> has a relatively longer dorsal region than any other
  Carnivore, and that it is most nearly approached by its allies
  <i>Ictonyx</i> and <i>Conepatus</i>. The molar formula is, as in
  <i>Arctonyx</i>, <i>Mydaus</i>, and <i>Helictis</i>, Pm&nbsp;4/4 M&nbsp;1/2. The
  molars differ from those of any other Carnivore in the much greater size
  of the first molars than of the last premolars. The nose is not grooved;
  the soles of the feet are naked. The claws of the fore-feet are much
  longer than those of the hind-feet.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Arctonyx</i> is a "pig-like badger" from Hindostan,
  Assam, and North China. The epithet "pig-like" is derived from the long
  and mobile snout, which is truncated and has terminal nostrils. It is
  remarkable for having a part of the palate formed by the pterygoids, as
  in Whales and certain Edentata (e.g. <i>Myrmecophaga</i>). There are
  sixteen dorsal vertebrae. <i>A. collaris</i> lives in <!-- Page 433
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page433"></a>{433}</span>fissures of
  rocks, or in holes dug by itself. It is a purely nocturnal beast.</p>

  <p>The singular genus <i>Mydaus</i>, containing the species <i>M.
  meliceps</i>, the Teledu or Javanese Skunk, is an inhabitant of Java and
  Sumatra. It frequents the mountains of these islands, into the soil of
  which it burrows in search of worms and larvae. There is but one species,
  which is "like a miniature badger, of rather eccentric colours." It is
  blackish brown, with a yellowish-white top to its head, and a stripe of
  the same colour down the back. It may be distinguished by its elongated
  snout, obliquely truncated, and with inferiorly-placed nostrils. As to
  osteological characters, it has a more oblique symphysis of the mandible
  than in any other Carnivore. The secretion of the anal glands is said to
  rival that of the Skunk in offensiveness and in the distance to which it
  can be propelled.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 2. Mustelinae.</b>&mdash;Representatives occur in both the
  Old and New Worlds; but the genera and even the species are in one or two
  cases common to both.</p>

  <p><i>Galictis barbara</i>,<a name="NtA_292"
  href="#Nt_292"><sup>[292]</sup></a> the Tayra, is a brown, elongated, and
  Weasel-like animal from Mexico and South America. As is the case with the
  Weasel, it is sometimes gregarious, a herd of twenty having been
  observed. The soles of the feet are naked, and the molar formula is
  Pm&nbsp;3/3 M&nbsp;1/2. In these characters the Grison (<i>G. vittata</i>) agrees
  with <i>G. barbara</i>; but it has been referred to a different genus,
  <i>Grisonia</i>.</p>

  <p>The Grison, "this savage and diabolical-looking weasel," as <!-- Page
  434 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page434"></a>{434}</span>Mr. Aplin
  terms it,<a name="NtA_293" href="#Nt_293"><sup>[293]</sup></a> is known
  also as the "Hurón." It almost rivals the Skunk in the power of the odour
  which it can emit when enraged. A trapped specimen was placed in a cage
  50 yards or so from the house, and even at this distance it was
  disagreeably easy to tell when any one visited the animal&mdash;at least
  when the wind set in the right direction. It is greyish yellow above and
  blackish beneath, presenting, as has been remarked, a curious similarity
  to the Ratel. The nose of this animal is destitute of a median groove,
  which is present in the Tayra; the soles of the feet, however, are naked
  as in that animal, and it is nearly plantigrade in walk. It differs also
  from <i>Galictis</i> in having sixteen<a name="NtA_294"
  href="#Nt_294"><sup>[294]</sup></a> instead of fourteen dorsal vertebrae.
  Eleven of the ribs reach the sternum. Considering the differences that
  exist between some other genera of Arctoids, it may be fairly allowed
  that a genus <i>Grisonia</i> is tenable.</p>

  <p><i>G. allamandi</i> is darker coloured than the Grison, with a white
  band from the forehead to the neck. Mr. T. Bell described a tame
  individual as eating eggs, frogs, and even a young alligator.</p>

  <p>A third genus of this group has recently been founded by Mr. Oldfield
  Thomas<a name="NtA_295" href="#Nt_295"><sup>[295]</sup></a> for a small
  African animal, which is Grison-like in its coloration. The name given to
  the genus, <i>Galeriscus</i>, is intended to suggest its likeness to the
  Grison (<i>Galera</i> or <i>Grisonia</i>). The chief distinctive feature
  of this genus, whose skeleton is not yet known, is the presence of only
  four digits on each limb; the pollex and the hallux being entirely
  absent. The ears of this Grison are short. <!-- Page 435 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page435"></a>{435}</span></p>

  <p>The genus <i>Mustela</i> includes the Martens and Sables, which are
  distinguished from the following genus by the molar formula, which is
  Pm&nbsp;4/4 M&nbsp;1/2. The same character separates them from <i>Galictis</i>, and
  also the generally hairy under surface of the feet. In more southern
  latitudes, however, the palms are sometimes naked. The nose is grooved,
  and the ears are short and broad. The genus is widely distributed, being
  common to the Old and New Worlds. In the Old World it extends from Europe
  to Java, Sumatra, and Borneo. The largest species of the genus is the
  American Pekan, an animal which may be 46 inches in length, including the
  tail. There are two species of Sable, one European (<i>M. zibellina</i>),
  the other American.</p>

  <p>The only British species of the genus is the Pine Marten, <i>M.
  martes</i>. It is dark brown, with a brownish-yellow throat, and reaches
  a length of some 17 inches, with an eight-inch tail. It is getting rare,
  but is still fairly common in the Lake country. The animal is largely
  arboreal in habit, whence the vernacular name. It is also called Marten
  Cat. The allied <i>M. foina</i>, the Beech Marten, has been stated to be,
  but apparently is not, an inhabitant of these islands. The colour of the
  animal is a rich brown. It has small eyes and ears and a short tail. The
  palms of the hands and the soles of the feet are hairy; the muzzle is
  naked, and has a groove as in <i>Cercoleptes</i>, etc.</p>

  <p>The Glutton, <i>Gulo</i>, is a well-marked genus, containing but one
  species, which is circumpolar in range. The dentition is Pm&nbsp;4/4 M&nbsp;1/2.
  The ferocity but not the voracity of this animal appears to have been
  exaggerated. It mainly feeds on carcases, and is not really a successful
  hunter. As to the carcases, Olaus Magnus tells in straightforward
  language the way in which the animal dilates in size during a meal, and
  presently, after following the practice of the ancient Romans, returns to
  the banquet: "Creditur a natura creatum ad ruborem hominum qui vorando
  bibendoque vomunt redeuntque ad mensam"!</p>

  <p>This is one of the few land animals which ranges completely round the
  pole. There is no difference to be noted between the Old-World and the
  New-World specimens. It is now an entirely northern form, but in
  Pleistocene times it reached as far south as this country. The fossil
  species seems to be <i>Gulo luscus</i>, and to be quite indistinguishable
  from the living forms.</p>

  <p><i>Putorius</i>, the genus which embraces the Weasel tribe, contains
  <!-- Page 436 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page436"></a>{436}</span>many species known popularly as Weasels,
  Ermines, Stoats, Ferrets, Polecats, Minks, and Vison. Not only is the
  genus common to both Old and New Worlds, but in a few cases the species
  (e.g. <i>P. erminea</i>) range from Asia to America. The molar formula is
  Pm&nbsp;3/3 M&nbsp;1/2. The form of the body is an exaggerated one, the length of
  the trunk to the limbs being very great. The feet are more or less hairy
  beneath, and the animals are digitigrade. The nose is grooved. The dorsal
  vertebrae vary from thirteen to sixteen.</p>

<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 221.&mdash;Polecat. <i>Mustela putorius.</i> × <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">6</span>.</p>

  <p>There are four British representatives of this genus<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>The Polecat, <i>P. foetidus</i>, is a dark brown-coloured animal. Its
  total length is about 2 feet, of which the tail occupies some 7 inches.
  It is a species banned by the gamekeeper, and hence is approaching
  extinction in this country. It is excessively bloodthirsty, as are
  apparently all the members of this genus, and kills out of mere
  wantonness. The Ferret is simply a domesticated variety of the
  Polecat.</p>

  <p>The Stoat or Ermine, <i>P. erminea</i>, is reddish brown above, white
  beneath. In winter, in certain localities, it becomes white with the
  exception of the black tip of the tail. This colour-change bears some
  relation to the degree of latitude. It is universal in the north of
  Scotland, rare in the south of England. As is the case with some other
  animals that generally change <!-- Page 437 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page437"></a>{437}</span>their colour in the winter, there are
  individuals which seem to have lost the power of change, and others which
  change in an apparently capricious manner, not influenced by season or
  cold. Like so many other animals, the Stoat appears at times to migrate,
  which it does in large parties. Such parties are said to be dangerous,
  and will attack a man who crosses their path.</p>

  <p>The Weasel, <i>P. vulgaris</i>, has much the same colour as the Stoat,
  but is a smaller animal; it differs also by undergoing no seasonal
  change. It is equally agile and ferocious, and ought to be encouraged, as
  it vents its ferocity largely upon Voles and Moles, which it can pursue
  underground. Like other species of <i>Putorius</i>, it seems to kill its
  prey by biting through the brain-case.</p>

  <p>The fourth British species is the recently-described Irish Stoat,
  <i>P. hibernicus</i>. It is somewhat intermediate between the last
  two.</p>

  <p><i>Poecilogale</i> is a genus recently instituted by Mr. Thomas for a
  small South African Weasel, <i>P. albinucha</i>, coloured like the
  Zorilla, <i>i.e.</i> with whitish stripes upon black, but differing in
  its reduced molar formula, which is Pm&nbsp;2/2 M&nbsp;1/1 or 1/2.</p>

  <p><i>Lyncodon</i><a name="NtA_296" href="#Nt_296"><sup>[296]</sup></a>
  is thought to be more doubtful; it is South American (Patagonian), with
  the same molar formula as the most reduced forms of the last genus,
  <i>i.e.</i> Pm&nbsp;2/2 M&nbsp;1/1. The ears are short and almost invisible; the
  claws of the anterior limbs are long, those of the hind limbs short. It
  is not quite certain that it is not "an aberrant southern form of
  <i>Putorius brasiliensis</i>." That its distinction is justifiable
  appears to be shown by the discovery in the same region of a fossil
  species, <i>L. luganensis</i>. Matschie places it near
  <i>Galictis</i>.</p>

  <p>The Ratel, <i>Mellivora</i>, is common to India and West and South
  Africa. It is a black animal with a grey back and grey on the top of the
  head, the contrast of colour suggesting a dorsal carapace. It runs with a
  swift trot. The animal lives much on the ground, but can climb trees. It
  is exclusively nocturnal in its habits. It has the reputation in India of
  feeding upon dead bodies, a view which has probably no foundation in fact
  save that it can burrow. The molar formula is Pm&nbsp;3/3 M&nbsp;1/1. There are
  fourteen dorsal vertebrae. The African and Indian species are <!-- Page
  438 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page438"></a>{438}</span>hardly to
  be distinguished from each other. The ears are very minute. The tail is
  short. The muzzle is rather pointed, and the soles and palms are
  naked.</p>

  </div>
<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 222.&mdash;Ratel. <i>Mellivora capensis.</i> × &#x215B;.</p>

  <p>The structure of <i>Helictis</i> has been described by the late
  Professor Garrod,<a name="NtA_297" href="#Nt_297"><sup>[297]</sup></a> as
  well as by Sir W. Flower in his general account of the Carnivorous
  skeleton. The animal, which is a native of East Asia, is sometimes gaily
  coloured. <i>H. subaurantiaca</i>, the species dissected and figured by
  Garrod, is a varied black and orange. The genus is arboreal, and the tail
  may be moderately long and bushy. The ears are small; the nose is
  grooved; the palms are naked, but the soles of the feet are hairy. There
  are fourteen dorsal vertebrae. The molar formula is Pm&nbsp;4/4 M&nbsp;1/2.</p>

  <p>The Zorilla, <i>Ictonyx</i>, is the last of the Old-World genera of
  Melinae. It is African, ranging from the tropical parts of the continent
  to the Cape. "In colour and markings," remarks Dr. Mivart, "as well as in
  the odour of the secretion of its anal glands, the one or two species
  which form this genus resemble the skunks; so much so that did they
  inhabit the same region, and were they devoid of an offensive secretion,
  they would certainly be said to mimic the skunks." The molar formula of
  the genus is Pm&nbsp;3/3 M&nbsp;1/2. There are fifteen dorsal vertebrae. The nose
  is grooved and the soles partly hairy.</p>

  <p>The American Badger, <i>Taxidea</i>, is a burrower of omnivorous
  tastes, and correlated with the former habit are the immense <!-- Page
  439 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page439"></a>{439}</span>claws of
  the fore-paws. It is North American, but gets into Mexico. The molar
  formula is as in the American genera <i>Mephitis</i> and
  <i>Conepatus</i>, and as in the Old-World <i>Ictonyx</i>, and it thus
  differs from that of <i>Meles</i>. Besides the great size of the claws
  upon the hand, which are larger relatively than those of any other
  Carnivore, the genus <i>Taxidea</i> is to be distinguished from all
  Arctoids (indeed, from all Carnivora) except <i>Mydaus</i>, by the fact
  that the pelvic limb is of the same length as the pectoral. The muzzle is
  furry except at the very extremity; this is grooved. The animal is
  carnivorous, subsisting upon the following very varied kinds of
  food&mdash;"Spermophiles, Arvicolas, birds' eggs, and snails, also
  honey-comb, wax, and bees."</p>

  <p>The Skunk, <i>Mephitis</i>, is an American animal with several
  species, which range from North to Central America. The black-and-white
  colour distinguishes the genus, which is furthermore marked by the fact
  that the third digit of the hand is relatively longer than in any other
  Carnivore except <i>Taxidea</i>. The soles are partly hairy. It is a
  terrestrial fossorial animal with well-known powers of protecting itself
  from aggression. But nevertheless the Skunk has its enemies, and is not
  quite so unmolested as is sometimes popularly supposed. The Puma, Harpy
  Eagle, and the Great Horned Owl will at least occasionally attack and
  devour it. The molar formula is Pm&nbsp;3/3 M&nbsp;1/2. There are sixteen dorsal
  vertebrae.</p>

  <p><i>Conepatus</i> is a more southern form of Skunk, extending down into
  South America. Its dentition is like that of <i>Mephitis</i> save for the
  loss of an upper premolar. This genus, which has been further subdivided,
  differs from <i>Mephitis</i> in the fact that the soles of the feet are
  wholly naked, whereas in Mephitis those of the hind-limbs are partially
  hairy. It has no groove on the nose. Its tail is shorter than that of
  <i>Mephitis</i>. This Skunk has the same habits as the last. In certain
  parts of South America the animals are so abundant and their odour so
  powerful that in the evening there is generally a recognisable smell
  about. This is said to be good for the headache!</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 3. Lutrinae.</b>&mdash;Of this sub-family there are at
  least two genera. <i>Enhydris</i> (<i>Latax</i>),<a name="NtA_298"
  href="#Nt_298"><sup>[298]</sup></a> the Sea-Otter, is confined to the
  shores of the North Pacific. It is more purely aquatic than are <!-- Page
  440 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page440"></a>{440}</span>other
  Otters. Specimens have been seen swimming fifteen miles from land. The
  gait of the creature when on land is suggestive of a marine animal; the
  webbed hind-feet are doubled back upon the knuckles during progression
  upon land, and locomotion is effected by a series of short springs from
  these feet; the Otter does not walk "in ordinary acceptance of the term."
  The tail is flattened, being twice as broad as it is thick, and ends in a
  bluntish point. <i>Enhydris</i> feeds mainly upon crabs and sea-urchins,
  but also upon fish. Its dental formula is peculiar by reason chiefly of
  the reduction of the lower incisors. The formula runs as follows: I&nbsp;3/2
  C&nbsp;1/1 Pm&nbsp;3/3 M&nbsp;1/2.</p>

  <p>The molar teeth of this creature, in accordance with its diet, have
  lost the sharp points of the Mustelidae in general; the crowns are
  flattened, and the tubercles very blunt. In this it contrasts with
  <i>Lutra</i>, and presents some resemblance to the Crab-eating Raccoon,
  <i>Procyon cancrivorus</i>; but the teeth are still further blunted.
  <i>Enhydris</i> feeds largely upon sea-urchins and shell-fish, and needs
  blunt teeth for the crushing of the hard shells of its prey. It is
  interesting to notice that the habits of this animal have been altered by
  the interference of man. The creature has been hotly pursued for a long
  time on account of its valuable fur. Instead of feeding and breeding upon
  the shore in places readily accessible to its pursuers, the Sea-Otter has
  now taken to the open sea in a greater degree. It utilises masses of
  floating seaweed for those purposes, and hunts for its food in the deeper
  water at a greater distance from the shore. In conjunction with the
  increasing rarity of the Sea-Otter the price of its skin has enormously
  increased: whereas in 1888 the average price per skin was £21:10s., the
  value of a fine skin now is at least £100, and as much as £200 and even
  £250 has been given. The animal is captured by netting and by clubbing
  and spearing.<a name="NtA_299" href="#Nt_299"><sup>[299]</sup></a> From
  the Miocene Siwalik beds remains of an allied form, <i>Enhydridon</i>,
  have been obtained, whose teeth are somewhat intermediate in their crowns
  between <i>Lutra</i> and <i>Enhydris</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Lutra</i>, including the Otters, is widely distributed. Both manus
  and pes are webbed. The ears are small and hairy. The nose is not
  grooved, and the naked part is very circumscribed; <!-- Page 441 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page441"></a>{441}</span>the claws upon the
  hind-feet are flattened and somewhat nail-like. There are about ten
  species, but of course, as is so universally the case, a great many more
  names have been given. The molar formula is like that of <i>Enhydris</i>
  save that there is an extra premolar in the upper jaw. There are fourteen
  pairs of ribs, of which eleven pairs reach the ten-jointed sternum. The
  caudals are twenty-three. The Cape Otter, the "clawless" Otter, has been
  separated as a genus <i>Aonyx</i>. So too has the South American
  <i>Pteronura brasiliensis</i>. But in neither case is the separation
  allowed by Mr. Thomas in a recent revision of the genus.<a name="NtA_300"
  href="#Nt_300"><sup>[300]</sup></a> The latter species has the reputation
  of being very fierce, and is known in Uruguay by the name of "Lobo de
  pecho blanco." The British species, <i>L. vulgaris</i>, reaches a length
  of 2 feet or so, with a tail of 16 inches; it ranges over the whole of
  Europe and a large portion of Asia. This Otter often burrows in the banks
  of the streams which it frequents; and in the burrow in March or April
  the female brings forth her young, three to five in number. It will also
  frequent the sea-coast.</p>

  <p><b>Fossil Mustelidae.</b>&mdash;Besides a number of the existing
  genera there are fossil members of this family which cannot be referred
  to existing genera. These latter extend back into time as far as the
  Eocene. <i>Stenoplesictis</i>, one of these Eocene forms referable to the
  sub-family Mustelinae, is to be distinguished <!-- Page 442 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page442"></a>{442}</span>from living Mustelines
  by its comparatively long legs. In this genus as in several others there
  are two upper molars.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 8. Ursidae.</b>&mdash;This family is nearly universal in
  distribution, and consists of but three genera, <i>Ursus</i>,
  <i>Melursus</i>, and <i>Aeluropus</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Ursus</i> has the palms and soles naked except in the Polar Bear,
  which needs a furry sole to walk with ease upon ice surfaces. The ears
  are fairly large, and the nose may or may not be traversed by a median
  groove.<a name="NtA_301" href="#Nt_301"><sup>[301]</sup></a> The molar
  formula<a name="NtA_302" href="#Nt_302"><sup>[302]</sup></a> is Pm&nbsp;4/4
  M&nbsp;2/3. The brain is naturally (because of the size of the animals of this
  genus) richly convoluted. The lobate kidneys have already been mentioned
  in defining this family (see p. <a href="#page426">426</a>).</p>

  <p>A very large number of species of Bears have been described. But it is
  the opinion of Mr. Lydekker<a name="NtA_303"
  href="#Nt_303"><sup>[303]</sup></a> and of others that many of these are
  really to be referred to the European Brown Bear; in this event the
  Grizzly of North America, the Isabelline Bear, the Syrian Bear, a Bear
  from Algeria, the Kamschatkan and Japanese Bears, besides the extinct
  <i>Ursus fossilis</i> of Pleistocene caves, are to be regarded as slight
  modifications of <i>Ursus arctos</i>. On the other hand, the great Cave
  Bear, <i>U. spelaeus</i>, <!-- Page 443 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page443"></a>{443}</span>and the Thibetan Blue Bear (<i>U.
  pruinosus</i>) are distinct species, not to be confounded with <i>U.
  arctos</i>. Neither, of course, are the Peruvian <i>U. ornatus</i> and
  the Sun Bear, <i>U. malayanus</i>.</p>

<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 225.&mdash;Malayan Bear. <i>Ursus malayanus.</i> × <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">12</span>.</p>

  <p>The Polar Bear has even been placed in a separate genus,
  <i>Thalassarctos</i>, a proceeding which is quite unnecessary. The white
  colour of this Bear tends to become browner with age. It is one of the
  few mammals which extend right round the pole; the Polar Bear is of
  course a purely Arctic animal. The chief food of the Polar Bear is Seal.
  Out of thirty Bears examined, Mr. Koettlitz found that only fifteen had
  animal remains in their stomachs, and these remains were invariably Seal.
  The animal apparently hunts by scent rather than by sight or hearing,
  both of which senses seem to be somewhat dull. The males and females
  wander separately, except of course during the breeding season. The Bears
  dig holes in which they may remain for some time, but there is no
  hibernation. In Pleistocene times, the Polar Bear extended as far south
  as Hamburg. The female has four mammae, pectoral in position.</p>

  <p><i>Melursus</i> includes only <i>M. labiatus</i>, the Sloth Bear of
  India. This animal has an upturned snout, which is described as closely
  resembling that of <i>Mydaus</i>, the Teledu. The snout has no groove.
  <!-- Page 444 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page444"></a>{444}</span>All Bears are largely vegetarian and
  insect feeders; but this Bear is especially so. It delights in the nests
  of Termites, and its energy in destroying these hills for the sake of
  their inhabitants is so great that the name of "sloth" appeared to Sir
  Samuel Baker to be an entire misnomer.</p>

  <p><i>Aeluropus</i>, a rare Carnivore with but one species, <i>A.
  melanoleucus</i>, is not inferior in size to the Brown Bear, and is
  distinguished by its largely white coloration. It was discovered in the
  mountains of East Thibet by Père David, and described by Milne-Edwards<a
  name="NtA_304" href="#Nt_304"><sup>[304]</sup></a> as a distinct and new
  genus, the discoverer himself having named it as a species of
  <i>Ursus</i>. It is a vegetable-feeding creature and bulky in form, with
  a rudimentary tail and a short broad head; in fact, more like a Bear than
  a Procyonid (with which group it is placed by some). The width of the
  head, however, is greater than in any other Carnivore; it is most closely
  approached in this by <i>Aelurus</i> and by <i>Hyaena</i>. The molar
  formula is Pm&nbsp;4/3 M&nbsp;2/3. The soles are hairy. There is no alisphenoid
  canal. The molars are especially large and multicuspid.</p>

  <p><b>Fossil Ursidae.</b>&mdash;The genus <i>Ursus</i> itself goes back
  to Pliocene times. The well-known Cave Bear, <i>Ursus spelaeus</i> of
  <!-- Page 445 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page445"></a>{445}</span>Pleistocene times, was one of the
  commonest of Carnivorous creatures during the very early times of the
  present era. It was as huge as a Polar Bear or a Grizzly. The skull is
  remarkable for the fact that the first three premolars, which are small
  in all Bears, dropped out early in life. An immense number of names have
  been given to what are in all probability the same species as this Cave
  Bear of remote antiquity.</p>

  <p><i>Hyaenarctos</i> is the oldest genus of true Ursidae. It goes back
  into Middle Miocene times, and ranged over Europe and North Africa.</p>

  <p><i>Arctotherium</i> is an American genus of Pleistocene times. The
  likeness of some of the extinct Canidae to Bears has been already
  commented upon.</p>

<h6>CARNIVORA (<i>CONTINUED</i>)&mdash;PINNIPEDIA (SEALS AND WALRUSES)&mdash;CREODONTA</h6>

<h5><span class="sc">Sub-Order 2.</span> PINNIPEDIA</h5>

  <p>This group includes the Seals, Sea-Lions, and Walruses,<a
  name="NtA_305" href="#Nt_305"><sup>[305]</sup></a> all aquatic and, for
  the larger part, marine creatures. Being aquatic they have to some extent
  acquired a fish-like form, though not so completely as have the Whales
  and even the Sirenia. This is most complete so far as the group is
  concerned in the Seals, where the hind-limbs have become soldered to the
  tail and are inefficient as walking legs, where the external ears have
  vanished, and where the general shape of the body is tapering and thus
  fish-like. The Walruses and Sea-Lions are less modified in this
  direction; in the latter (not in the former) the external ear, though
  small, is persistent, and the hind-limbs are capable of being used as
  organs of progression upon dry land. The general characters applicable to
  the Carnivora, given upon a previous page, apply to the Pinnipedia.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:70%;">
      <a href="images/227.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/227.jpg"

  </div>
<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 227.&mdash;Skeleton of Seal. <i>Phoca vitulina.</i> (After de Blainville.)</p>

  <p>The characters confined to the Pinnipedia as a whole are mainly
  these<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span>The greater part of the limbs are
  enclosed within the skin, the hands and feet are fully webbed, and there
  is a tendency for the nails to disappear, and for the phalanges to
  increase in number&mdash;characters which are clearly not diagnostic of
  the order but correlated with an aquatic life, since they reappear, and
  are indeed exaggerated, in the Cetacea. The teeth are peculiar in that
  the milk dentition is feeble and is early shed. This, as it were, undue
  emphasis upon one of the two sets of teeth is another likeness to the
  Whales, <!-- Page 447 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page447"></a>{447}</span>where, however, it is the milk dentition
  that is most pronounced, the "permanent" being feeble and very early
  shed. But the dentition of the Pinnipedes presents other likenesses to
  the Cetacea, which are, it must be remembered, regarded by some as a
  modification of the Carnivorous stock, in which case, of course, the
  likenesses may be genetic rather than due to adaptation in the two cases.
  There is a distinct tendency towards a homodont series, the grinding
  teeth being often very simple, and the very distinct carnassial tooth of
  many terrestrial Carnivores being absent. Finally, the number of the back
  teeth shows some signs of being on the increase; and Professor Kükenthal
  has found that this increase is due to the division of existing teeth.
  Here is a point of likeness to the many teeth of the typical Toothed
  Whales. Dr. Nehring found in several examples of <i>Halichoerus
  grypus</i> the normal five back teeth increased to <!-- Page 448 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page448"></a>{448}</span>six, and the additional
  molar was at the end of the series, thus suggesting a lengthening of jaw
  coupled with an increase in number of teeth.</p>

  <p>The incisor teeth of the Pinnipedia differ from those of the land
  Carnivora in that there are nearly always fewer than 3/3, at least in the
  adult animal. In possessing lobulated kidneys the Pinnipedia differ from
  all terrestrial Carnivores except the Otters and Bears&mdash;a
  significant fact.</p>

  <p>In the characters of the skeleton the Pinnipedia show many
  peculiarities. The cranial part of the skull is proportionately to the
  facial part greater than in terrestrial Carnivora; there is no lachrymal
  bone, and the orbit is to some extent defective in ossification. The
  alisphenoid canal, so important a feature in the Carnivora, may be
  present or absent. It is present, for example, in <i>Otaria jubata</i>.<a
  name="NtA_306" href="#Nt_306"><sup>[306]</sup></a> This genus also has
  the more primitive small and rugged tympanic bullae, which are inflated
  and more Cat-like in others. The vertebrae show an interesting Creodont
  peculiarity in the complex interlocking arrangements of the zygapophyses
  of the dorsal vertebrae. The ossicula auditus differ from those of their
  terrestrial allies in their large size and massive growth. In this they
  have come to be like those of the Whales and Sirenians.</p>

  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page449"></a>{449}</span>terrestrial
  Carnivora, but the question is, to which group of Carnivora have they the
  most likeness. The semiaquatic Otter, and the still more thoroughly
  aquatic (marine) <i>Enhydris</i>, suggest an affinity in that direction.
  The long body and short legs of the Otter, which is more thoroughly at
  home pursuing fish in the streams than in waddling clumsily upon the
  banks of the streams, seem to require but little external change to
  convert it into a small Seal, while the long and completely webbed hind
  digits of <i>Enhydris</i> are even more like those of a Pinniped. The
  Sea-Lions, in which the external ear has been preserved, and in which the
  limbs have not become so entirely useless for progression on the land as
  they have in the Seals, seem to be the intermediate step in the evolution
  of the latter. This, however, is not the opinion of Dr. Mivart, who,
  without definitely committing himself on the point, presents some
  evidence for the assumption that the marine Carnivora are diphyletic.
  This double origin, however, is not from two groups of the terrestrial
  Carnivora. Dr. Mivart, in common with many others, holds that the
  Pinnipedia as a whole are undoubtedly nearer to the Arctoidea than to
  either of the two remaining sections of the sub-order. One of the most
  striking structural characters in which they show this resemblance is the
  brain; the peculiar Ursine lozenge, already treated of as so distinctive
  a character of the Arctoidea, is repeated in the Pinnipedia.</p>

  <p>There are, however, other points of likeness which seem rather to
  point to a Creodont origin. <i>Patriofelis</i> is a genus that from more
  than one side may be looked upon as a possible ancestor of these animals.
  The Creodont peculiarity of the vertebrae has already been referred to.
  It may be added that the facial part of the skull is small in
  <i>Patriofelis</i>, which appears, moreover, to have had an alisphenoid
  canal. A very remarkable resemblance lies in the structure of the
  astragalus. This is not deeply grooved on the tibial facet as it is in
  Fissiped Carnivora. This might be held to be an instance of degeneration
  in the aquatic Seals, which do not use their limbs as walking organs. But
  Professor Wortman<a name="NtA_307" href="#Nt_307"><sup>[307]</sup></a>
  has pointed out that in the Sea-Otter, which is entirely aquatic, the
  groove exists and is plain. The likeness offered to the Seals by the
  spreading feet of <i>Patriofelis</i> is noticed under the description of
  that genus.<a name="NtA_308" href="#Nt_308"><sup>[308]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Otariidae.</b>&mdash;The family Otariidae<a name="NtA_309"
  href="#Nt_309"><sup>[309]</sup></a> is no doubt the least modified of the
  aquatic Carnivora. It is rational, therefore, to commence the survey of
  the group with this family. They have preserved, as already noted, the
  independence of the hind-limbs; the external ear is present, though
  small; there is an obvious neck, and the nostrils are at the end of the
  snout, as in terrestrial creatures generally. The nails are small and
  rudimentary, save those upon the three middle digits of the foot. It is a
  singular fact that among the Otaries the angle of the lower jaw is
  "inflected as much as in any Marsupial." The literature relating to this
  family is great, and it seems difficult to reconcile the very varying
  opinions as to how many genera ought to be admitted. Mr. Allen arranged
  the nine species which he allowed <!-- Page 451 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page451"></a>{451}</span>in six genera; but more
  generic names have been proposed. At the other extreme stands Dr. Mivart,
  who speaks of only one genus, <i>Otaria</i>; of this genus the number of
  species is by no means agreed upon. There can, however, be no doubt of
  the distinctness of the Northern Fur Seal, <i>O. ursina</i> (the "Seal"
  of commerce and the cause of international complications), of the
  Patagonian Maned Sea-Lion, <i>O. jubata</i>,<a name="NtA_310"
  href="#Nt_310"><sup>[310]</sup></a> of <i>O. pusilla</i> of the Cape, of
  the Californian <i>O. gillespiei</i>, of <i>O. hookeri</i> from the
  Auckland Islands, and of four or five others. The range of the genus is
  wide, but is mainly Antarctic. It is usual to speak of "Hair Seals" and
  "Fur Seals," the latter being the species which produce the "sealskin" of
  commerce. The difference is that in the Fur Seals there is a dense, soft
  under-fur, which is wanting in the other group. It is, however,
  impossible to make this character the basis of a generic subdivision.
  There is a Fur Seal, <i>O. nigrescens</i>, in South America as well as
  the more widely-known northern form.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Trichechidae.</b>&mdash;This family contains but one genus,
  <i>Trichechus</i>, the Walrus or Morse, or <i>Odobaenus</i>, as the more
  correct term seems to be. It is a tiresome result of accurate conformity
  with the rules of priority in nomenclature that the name
  <i>Trichechus</i> should be applied to the Manatee. There is but one
  species of Walrus, though it has been attempted to show that the Pacific
  and Eastern forms are different. The animal is Arctic and circumpolar.
  The Walrus is characterised by the enormous canines of its upper jaw,
  which form the well-known tusks and reach a length of 30 inches. The
  animal can progress on land like the Sea-Lions; but, as in the Seals,
  there are no external ears, though there is a slight protuberance above
  the meatus auditorius. The strong bristles upon the upper lip are as
  thick as crow quills. The pectoral limb has nails, but these are small,
  as in the Sea-Lions. The under surface of the manus has a warty pad,
  which cannot but assist<a name="NtA_311"
  href="#Nt_311"><sup>[311]</sup></a> in maintaining a foothold upon
  slippery ice. The hind-limbs have longer nails, which are still
  diminutive and subequal in size. There is no free tail. The liver of this
  animal is much furrowed, but not so much so as in <i>Otaria</i>, though
  more so than in <i>Phoca</i>. The kidneys are of course lobulate, as in
  the other aquatic Carnivores. The milk dental formula appears to be I&nbsp;3/3
  C&nbsp;1/1 Pm + M&nbsp;5/4. In the adult the formula<a name="NtA_312"
  href="#Nt_312"><sup>[312]</sup></a> is I&nbsp;1/0 C&nbsp;1/1 M&nbsp;3/3.</p>

<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 230.&mdash;Common Seal. <i>Phoca vitulina.</i> × &#x215B;. (From Parker and Haswell's <i>Zoology</i>.)</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Phocidae.</b>&mdash;The true Seals have no external ears,
  and the nostrils are quite dorsal in position as in other aquatic
  animals, such as the Crocodile. There is obviously an approach to the
  conditions characteristic of the Whales. The hind-limbs are useless for
  locomotion on land. They are bound up with the tail, and form
  functionally merely a part of the tail. In this family there are, at any
  rate, eight genera.</p>

  <p><i>Phoca</i> and <i>Halichoerus</i> are not very wide apart from each
  other. In both there are five well-developed claws on feet and hands.
  They are British, and generally Arctic and temperate in range. For some
  reason or other the late Dr. Gray placed <i>Halichoerus</i> in the same
  sub-family with the Walrus! <i>Phoca</i> is not only marine, but is found
  in the Caspian and in Lake Baikal. Their existence in those inland seas
  is believed to be a vestige of a former connexion with the sea.
  <i>Halichoerus grypus</i> is a large seal 8 feet in length when full
  grown. Its colour is yellowish grey, with darker grey spots and blotches.
  It is not uncommon on the shores of our islands, particularly of the
  Hebrides and Argyllshire. The commonest Seal is <i>Phoca vitulina</i>,
  not more than 4 to 5 feet long, and of the same spotted coloration as the
  last. This Seal has, however, a much wider distribution, being Arctic as
  well as British, American, and North Pacific. A curious fact about this
  Seal is that it is not impatient of fresh water; not only will it ascend
  rivers, but it will live in inland lakes. It is said to be especially
  sensitive to musical sounds. <i>P. hispida</i> is British, but a rare
  visitor to our islands. It is essentially an Arctic species. The Harp
  Seal, <i>P. groenlandica</i>, is so called on account of a harp-shaped
  black bar in the males, which starts at <!-- Page 453 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page453"></a>{453}</span>the shoulders and
  extends to the thighs. Like the other Seals mentioned, the young are
  white when first born. As may be inferred from its scientific name this
  species is also Arctic in range. It is also a rare visitor to these
  shores.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Cystophora</i> is the only other genus of which there is
  a British representative. It is called the Hooded Seal on account of an
  inflatable sac upon the face, with which it is said to attempt to terrify
  its enemies. The genus has an incisor less in each half of each jaw than
  <i>Phoca</i> and <i>Halichoerus</i>. Its formula is I&nbsp;2/1 while these
  genera are both 3/2. <i>C. cristata</i> is a large species reaching a
  length of 10 feet. The colour of the back is dark grey with deeper
  coloured spots. A few individuals only have been recorded from our
  coasts.</p>

  <p><i>Stenorhynchus</i> ( = <i>Ogmorhinus</i>) is an Antarctic genus. The
  hind-feet are clawless. The incisors are 2/2. The molars have an
  additional cusp, <i>i.e.</i> three in all.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Leptonyx</i> with but one species, <i>L. weddelli</i>, is
  purely Antarctic in range. Like the last genus it has two incisors, and
  has but rudimentary claws upon the hind-feet; the first and fifth toes
  moreover are the longest. The genus chiefly differs from the last in the
  simple conical crowns of the molars, which have not the additional cusps
  of <i>Stenorhynchus</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Ommatophoca</i> is another Antarctic genus with but a single
  species, <i>O. rossi</i>. In this genus the hind-feet have no claws, and
  the first and fifth toes are longer than the others. The claws of the
  fore-feet are rudimentary. The immense size of the orbits gives the name
  to the genus. There are two incisors, and the molars are all very
  small.</p>

  <p><i>Monachus</i> is a northern genus inhabiting the Mediterranean and
  the Atlantic in the vicinity of Madeira and the Canary Islands. It has
  rudimentary nails upon both pairs of feet. The first and fifth toe of the
  hind-feet are longer than the others. As with the preceding genera, the
  incisors are two in each jaw. The species are <i>M. albiventer</i>, the
  Monk-Seal, and <i>M. tropicalis</i>, the Jamaica Seal.</p>

  <p>Allied to <i>Cystophora</i> is the genus <i>Macrorhinus</i>, with
  (possibly) two species, of which one is Antarctic, the other frequents or
  frequented the coast of California. The incisors are two in the upper
  jaw, and but one in the lower. The premolars are four and the molar one;
  all the teeth are small and simple, but <!-- Page 454 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page454"></a>{454}</span>have long roots. The
  nose of the male has a dilatable proboscis. The southern Elephant Seal is
  <i>M. leoninus</i>, and reaches a length of some 20 feet. It occurs on
  the shores of Kerguelen and some other more or less remote islands. Its
  habits have been studied and described by several observers, beginning
  with Anson in the last century. The late Professor Moseley gave a good
  account of this marine monster in his book on the voyage of the
  "Challenger." When the animal is enraged, the end of the snout is
  dilated; but when this happens there is no long and hanging proboscis
  such as has sometimes been described. The inflation affects the skin on
  the top of the snout, which thus rises rather upwards during inflation.
  The inflated region, according to Mr. Vallentin, quoted by Mr. J. T.
  Cunningham, is about 1 foot long in an individual of 17 feet. It has been
  stated that this proboscis is a temporary structure, only appearing in
  the breeding season; but recent observations have shown that this
  statement is inaccurate; it persists all the year round. The males fight
  greatly during the breeding season, and produce a roar which has been
  compared to the "noise made by a man when gargling." The females and the
  young males bellow like a bull. The males fight of course with their
  teeth, literally falling upon one another with their whole weight. Mr.
  Cunningham thinks that the use of the proboscis is to protect the nose
  from injury; or that it may be merely the result of "emotional
  excitement." In any case the Bladder-nosed Seal, <i>Cystophora</i>, is
  undoubtedly protected from injury by the possession of a corresponding
  hood. The nose is the most vulnerable place, and the existence of this
  hood would stave off the effects of a blow in that region. Moseley,
  however, has said of <i>Macrorhinus</i> that it cannot be stunned by
  blows on the nose as other Seals can; but he attributes this, not to the
  dilated snout, but to the bony crest on the skull, and to the strength of
  the bones about the nose. This Seal crawls with difficulty on the land,
  and as the animals move "the vast body trembles like a great bag of
  jelly, owing to the mass of blubber by which the whole animal is
  invested, and which is as thick as it is in a whale."<a name="NtA_313"
  href="#Nt_313"><sup>[313]</sup></a> When lying on the shore, these
  animals scrape sand and throw it over themselves, apparently to prevent
  themselves from being <!-- Page 455 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page455"></a>{455}</span>incommoded by the direct rays of the sun,
  to the effects of which they are very susceptible. The Elephant Seal is
  mild and inoffensive, unless enraged, and, of course, during the breeding
  season.</p>

<h5><b>Order VIII. CREODONTA.</b></h5>

  <p>This entirely extinct group of Mammalia may be thus characterised<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span>Small to large carnivorous mammals, with skull
  on the whole like that of the Carnivora and with trenchant teeth; digits
  with unguiculate phalanges; tail long; extremities usually with five,
  sometimes with four digits. In the carpus a centrale is present, and the
  scaphoid and lunar are separate. Interlocking of posterior dorsal and
  lumbar zygapophyses very perfect. Brain small but convoluted.</p>

  <p>This group, which corresponds with the <span class="sc">Carnivora
  Primigenia</span> of Mr. Lydekker, is not easy to separate absolutely
  from the existing and more especially from some of the extinct members of
  the <span class="sc">Carnivora Vera</span>. They also come exceedingly
  near the Condylarthra, the presumed ancestors of the Ungulata, and like
  them begin in the earliest Tertiary deposits. Their likeness to the
  carnivorous Marsupials has also been insisted upon; but it would seem
  that the succession of teeth in the Creodonta is typically Eutherian.</p>

  <p>The characteristics of the group may be exemplified by an account of
  the genus <i>Hyaenodon</i>, after which some of the more important
  deviations in structure shown by other genera will be referred to.</p>

  <p><i>Hyaenodon</i> is both American and European, and ranges through the
  Eocene and the Upper Miocene. It is a much-specialised Creodont, and
  therefore exhibits well the distinctive characters of the group. About a
  dozen species have been described. One of the best-known is the American
  <i>H. cruentus</i>, and the following description refers to it. The back
  part of the skull is low and broad, and is compared by Professor Scott
  (who has described this and other species) as being "somewhat like that
  of an opossum."<a name="NtA_314" href="#Nt_314"><sup>[314]</sup></a> The
  whole skull is <!-- Page 456 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page456"></a>{456}</span>long, and the top has a great sagittal
  crest. The paroccipital processes are short and are closely applied to
  the mastoid processes. The mesethmoid is larger than in the carnivorous
  Marsupials, and the frontals are very large. The palate has a peculiar
  structure; in most species the hinder ends of the palatines are separated
  by a narrow fissure which broadens gradually, thus forming the posterior
  nares. In <i>H. leptocephalus</i> the posterior nares are brought very
  far back by the meeting of the alisphenoids. The presphenoid, contrary to
  what we find in the Dog, for example, is chiefly concealed by the vomer,
  which covers it. The mandible has a long and strong symphysis, and its
  angle is not inflected. The fore-limb is described as being "weak when
  compared with the modern Carnivora." The scaphoid and lunar are separate,
  and there is a centrale. The teeth present us with nearly the typical
  formula. There is only one molar missing in the upper jaw. The canines
  are enlarged. It has been suggested from a consideration of its palate
  that <i>Hyaenodon</i> was a semiaquatic animal; the deep cleaving at the
  extremities of the phalanges seems to point in the same direction, since
  they resemble in this the genus <i>Patriofelis</i>, which there are other
  reasons to regard as aquatic. This latter genus has a fore-limb which is
  very like that of the Pinnipedia, the digits are much spread out, and
  would seem to have supported a kind of paddle. In any case it certainly
  fed upon aquatic tortoises, for their remains have been found in its
  coprolites. The name <i>Limnofelis</i>, also applied to what appear to
  have been members of this genus, is suggestive of their habits.
  <i>Patriofelis</i>, at least one species, seems to have been of about the
  size of a Lion.</p>

  <p><i>Mesonyx</i> has a brain case which is actually smaller than that of
  the Marsupial <i>Thylacinus</i>. The lachrymal bone is very large, and
  extends a little way over the face, as is also the case with
  <i>Hyaenodon</i>; this condition is also found in Insectivora and in
  <i>Thylacinus</i>. The axis vertebra has a curiously-shaped spine, which
  is very different from the hatchet-shaped process of that vertebra usual
  in the Carnivora, but is not unlike what exists in the Arctoid genera
  <i>Meles</i> and <i>Mydaus</i>. The limbs show much disparity in length,
  and seem to argue a much-arched back when the creature progressed. The
  carpus is stated to be strikingly like that of the Insectivora. There is
  as in other Creodonts a separation between the scaphoid and lunar; <!--
  Page 457 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page457"></a>{457}</span>the
  centrale appears to be present. The pelvis "is most like that of the
  bear," the metacarpals and the tibia, and some other bones, resemble
  those of the Hyaena. In fact this animal shows those combined characters
  which are common in archaic forms.</p>

<h6>RODENTIA&mdash;TILLODONTIA</h6>

<h5><b>Order IX. RODENTIA<a name="NtA_315" href="#Nt_315"><sup>[315]</sup></a></b></h5>

  <p>Small to moderately large animals, furry, sometimes with spines. Toes
  with nails of a claw-like character, or sometimes approaching hoofs.
  Usually plantigrade, and only occasionally and partly carnivorous. Canine
  teeth absent; incisors long and strong, growing from persistent pulps,
  and with enamel only or chiefly on the anterior face, producing a
  chisel-shaped edge; molars few (two to six), separated from the incisors
  by a wide diastema. Caecum (nearly always present) very large, and often
  complicated in structure. Brain, if not smooth, with few furrows, the
  hemispheres not overlapping the cerebellum. Surface of skull rather flat;
  orbits not separated from temporal fossae; malar bone in middle of
  zygomatic arch; palate very narrow, with elongated incisive foramina;
  articular surface for lower jaw antero-posteriorly elongated. Clavicles
  generally present. Testes generally abdominal. Placenta deciduate, and
  discoidal in form.</p>

  <p>The Rodents are a very large assemblage of usually small, sometimes
  quite minute, creatures, embracing an enormous number of living generic
  types. They are distributed all over the world, including the Australian
  region, and, being small and often nocturnal, and by no means particular
  in their diet, have managed to thrive and multiply to a greater extent
  than any other group of living mammals. They are chiefly terrestrial
  creatures, and often burrow or live in ready-made burrows. <!-- Page 459
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page459"></a>{459}</span>Some, however,
  such as the Voles, are aquatic; others, <i>e.g.</i> the Squirrels, are
  arboreal, and there are "flying" Rodents exemplified by the genus
  <i>Anomalurus</i>. Their range of habitat is in fact as wide as that of
  any other Order of mammals, and wider than that of most.</p>

Flower's <i>Osteology</i>.)</p>

  <p>The most distinct anatomical characteristic of the Rodents concerns
  the teeth. They are without exception entirely deprived of canines. Thus
  there is a long diastema between the incisors and the molars. Another
  peculiarity is, that in many cases the dentition is absolutely
  monophyodont. In such forms as the Muridae there seems to be no milk
  dentition at all. In that family there are only three molars; but in
  other types where there are four, five, or six molars, the first one,
  two, or three, as the case may be, have milk predecessors, and may thus
  be termed premolars. This has been definitely proved to be the case in
  the common Rabbit, which has the unusually large number of six grinding
  teeth in each half of the upper jaw when adult. The first three of these
  have milk forerunners. On the other hand the existence of four molars
  does not apparently always argue that the first is a premolar; for Sir W.
  Flower found that in <i>Hydrochoerus</i>,<a name="NtA_316"
  href="#Nt_316"><sup>[316]</sup></a> none of the teeth had any
  forerunners, at any rate so far as could be detected from the examination
  of a very young animal. The Rabbit appears to be also exceptional, in
  that the second incisor of the upper jaw and the incisor of the lower jaw
  have milk forerunners. In any case the tendency towards monophyodontism
  is peculiarly well-marked in this group of mammals. The incisors of
  Rodents are as a rule in each jaw a single pair of long and strong teeth,
  which grow from persistent pulps, and <!-- Page 460 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page460"></a>{460}</span>grow to a very great
  length, extending back within the jaw to near the hinder part of the
  skull. These teeth are reinforced in the upper jaw by a small second pair
  in the Lagomorpha only. The incisors are chisel-shaped, and often brown
  or yellow upon the outer face, as is the case also with some
  Insectivores. This peculiar shape, and their strength, renders them
  especially capable of the gnawing action which characterises the Rodents.
  It has been pointed out that where the incisors are wider than thick, the
  gnawing powers are feebly developed; and that on the contrary, where
  these teeth are thicker than wide, the animals are good gnawers. The
  incisors have often an anterior groove, or it may be grooves.</p>

(<i>Sciurus</i>); <b>C</b>, of <i>Ctenodactylus</i>. (After Tullberg.)</p>

  <p>The cheek teeth vary in number from two (<i>Hydromys</i>) to six
  (Rabbit) on each side of the two jaws. Four is the prevailing number
  outside the large division of the Rat-like Rodents. They are often set at
  an angle to the horizontal plane of the jaw, looking outwards and
  obliquely to its longitudinal axis; the individual teeth too are not
  unfrequently bowed in form, reminding us of those of <i>Toxodon</i>. This
  of course only occurs in those genera which have hypselodont teeth. The
  pattern of the teeth varies much, and the different forms recall the
  teeth of more than one other group of mammals. They are either bunodont
  or lophodont. In many cases the tooth is encircled with a ridge of
  enamel, which is either almost simple or has a more complicated contour;
  such teeth are by no means unsuggestive of the Toxodonts. Some of the
  lophodont molars are by no means unlike those of the Proboscidea. In
  <i>Sciurus vulgaris</i> the <!-- Page 461 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page461"></a>{461}</span>encircling ridge is broken up into
  tubercles, which gives to the tooth a striking likeness to those of
  <i>Ornithorhynchus</i>. Other genera have teeth like those of many
  Ungulates. It has been shown by Sir J. Tomes<a name="NtA_317"
  href="#Nt_317"><sup>[317]</sup></a> that the minute structure of the
  enamel differs in different groups of Rodents.</p>

  <p>The skull shows certain primitive characters. In the first place there
  is no distinction between the orbital and the temporal fossa.<a
  name="NtA_318" href="#Nt_318"><sup>[318]</sup></a> The sutures between
  the bones retain their distinctness for very long. Other characteristic
  features are the following<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span>The nasals are
  large, and so are the paroccipital processes. The palate in front of the
  molars is not distinct from the sides of the skull, its edge gradually
  becoming rounded off above. It is also very narrow. The premaxillae are
  large in relation to the great incisors. There is often a very much
  enlarged infra-orbital foramen through which passes a part of the
  masseter muscle. The jugal bone lies in the middle of the zygomatic arch,
  which is complete and enormously enlarged in the Spotted Cavy
  (<i>Coelogenys paca</i>). As in many Marsupials, the jugal bone sometimes
  extends backwards to the glenoid cavity, where the lower jaw articulates.
  It is usually said with an absolute want of accuracy that the cerebral
  hemispheres of the Rodents are smooth and without convolutions. This
  error has been repeated again and again in text-books. As a matter of
  fact the cerebral hemispheres of many forms are quite well convoluted,<a
  name="NtA_319" href="#Nt_319"><sup>[319]</sup></a> the degree of
  furrowing corresponding, as in so many groups of mammals, with the size
  of the animal. This at any rate is generally true, though the large
  Beaver with its scant convolutions is an exception. The smaller forms,
  such as <i>Mus</i>, <i>Sciurus</i>, <i>Dipus</i>, and <i>Cricetus</i> are
  quite smooth-brained. The best furrowed brain of any Rodent which has
  been examined is that of the huge <i>Hydrochoerus</i>. The Sylvian
  fissure is very generally not pronounced; but is particularly well-marked
  in <i>Lagostomus</i>. In all, or in most, Rodents the hemispheres are
  separated by an interval from the cerebellum, the optic lobes being
  visible between the two.</p>

  <p>The mouth cavity of this group of mammals is divided into two chambers
  by a hairy ingrowth behind the incisors; this arrangement is useful for
  animals which use their strong incisors <!-- Page 462 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page462"></a>{462}</span>as gnawing and
  excavating tools as well as for the purposes of alimentation; for it
  allows of substances being gnawed away without the products of the
  chisel-like action being taken into the hinder cavity of the mouth. The
  Rodents have for the most part a simple stomach of normal form; but in a
  few this is complicated by a marked constriction, which divides the
  cardiac from the pyloric portions. The Hamster, for example, is thus
  characterised. In all the members of the order, with the exception of the
  Dormice and some allied forms, the caecum is large and often sacculated.
  In some forms (e.g. <i>Arvicola</i>, <i>Myodes</i>, <i>Cuniculus</i>) the
  large intestine is coiled upon itself in a spiral way&mdash;a state of
  affairs strongly suggestive of Ruminants.</p>

  <p>The Rodents are primarily divisible into two great groups, the
  Simplicidentata and the Duplicidentata, characterised mainly by the upper
  incisor teeth. In the former there is but one pair of these teeth; in the
  latter a second smaller pair lie behind the former.</p>

<h5><span class="sc">Sub-Order 1.</span> SIMPLICIDENTATA.</h5>

<h5><span class="sc">Section 1. Sciuromorpha.</span></h5>

  <p>The Anomaluri are separated by Thomas and others from this section as
  an equal section, while by Tullberg they are grouped with
  <i>Pedetes</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Anomaluridae.</b>&mdash;The genus <i>Anomalurus</i>
  suggests at first sight the Flying Squirrels of Asia, <i>Pteromys</i>. It
  is, however, an entirely African genus, and is to be distinguished from
  the Asiatic Rodents by a series of scales at the root of the tail,
  imbricated, keeled, and forming possibly a "climbing organ." This
  character serves also to distinguish the present genus from
  <i>Sciuropterus</i>. The cartilage, moreover, which supports the patagium
  springs from the elbow. There are four molars in each half of each jaw.
  The eyes and ears are large. There are five fingers and toes, but the
  thumb is small, though provided with a nail. The sternum has seven
  joints, and nine ribs reach it. The clavicle is strong. Huet, who has
  recently monographed the genus,<a name="NtA_320"
  href="#Nt_320"><sup>[320]</sup></a> allows six species. The species vary
  in size. <!-- Page 463 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page463"></a>{463}</span></p>

  <p><i>Anomalurus peli</i> appears, according to Mr. W. H. Adams,<a
  name="NtA_321" href="#Nt_321"><sup>[321]</sup></a> to be a common species
  on the Gold Coast; it is coloured black and white, but in spite of the
  warning which this colour should convey, is considered by the perhaps
  rather omnivorous native as "the greatest delicacy." The animal is
  nocturnal, but affects only bright moonlight nights. Their "flying"
  consists of a jump from a high branch to a lower one, after which they
  reascend the tree to a point of vantage for another jump. They are said
  to feed upon nuts; but Tullberg only found the remains of leaves in the
  stomach.</p>

  <p><i>Idiurus</i> is a lately-described genus allied to
  <i>Anomalurus</i>. There are at any rate two species, <i>I. zenkeri</i>
  and <i>I. macrotis</i>. The thumb is more reduced than in
  <i>Anomalurus</i>, and the fibula, contrary to what is found in that
  genus and in most Sciuromorphs, is fused with the tibia below.</p>

  <p>A third genus, very recently described and allied to both the
  foregoing, is <i>Aëthurus</i>. It is a native of the French Congo,<a
  name="NtA_322" href="#Nt_322"><sup>[322]</sup></a> and differs by the
  absence of flying membranes. It has, however, the pad of large scales.
  There is but one species, <i>A. glirinus</i>. It has a black bushy tail.
  The postorbital processes of the frontals are totally wanting&mdash;there
  are not even the traces to be seen in <i>Anomalurus</i>. The thumb has
  vanished. If we are to compare <i>Anomalurus</i> with the Squirrels then,
  thinks Mr. de Winton, the present genus is probably diurnal by reason of
  the want of flying membranes.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Sciuridae.</b>&mdash;The Squirrels, genus <i>Sciurus</i>,
  are world-wide in range, the Australian region and the island of
  Madagascar being alone excepted.</p>

  <p>The eyes and the ears are large; the tail is of course long and bushy.
  The fore-feet have an inconspicuous thumb; the hind-feet have four toes.
  The soles of the fore-feet are naked or furry, those of the hind-feet are
  hairy. There are twelve or thirteen dorsal vertebrae, and in
  correspondence seven or six lumbars. The caudal vertebrae may be as many
  as twenty-five. In the skull the frontals are broad, and there are long
  <!-- Page 464 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page464"></a>{464}</span>postorbital processes. The infra-orbital
  foramen is, as a rule, not large, but is increased in size in a few
  forms. The number of separate pieces of bone in the sternum is five. The
  molars of the upper jaw are five, but the first is very small and soon
  drops out.</p>

  <p>The Squirrels are often rather brilliantly coloured. The Chinese
  <i>Sc. castaneiventris</i> has grey fur with a rich chestnut-coloured
  under surface. The Malabar Squirrel, <i>Sc. maximus</i>, as its name
  implies, a large animal, has a deep reddish or chestnut-coloured fur
  above, which becomes yellow below. The "Common Squirrel," "the lytill
  squerell full of besynesse," which is the Squirrel of this country, is
  brownish red on the upper parts and white below. It ranges from this
  country as far east as Japan. Like many other Rodents the Squirrel likes
  animal food and will eat both eggs and young birds. "Camel's hair"
  brushes are made from this animal. The genus <i>Tamias</i>, almost
  exclusively North American in range, is included by Dr. Forsyth Major<a
  name="NtA_323" href="#Nt_323"><sup>[323]</sup></a> in this genus, which
  then consists of considerably over one hundred species.</p>

  <p>The Ethiopian Ground Squirrels, genus <i>Xerus</i>, have a more
  elongated skull than <i>Sciurus</i>, and the postorbital processes are
  shorter. The feet are not hairy.</p>

  <p><i>Nannosciurus</i> forms a perfectly distinct genus of Squirrels.
  These "Pygmy Squirrels" differ in possessing a very elongated "face" and
  in the very broad frontal region. The teeth are unlike those of
  <i>Sciurus</i> in certain features, and have been especially compared by
  Forsyth Major to those of the Dormice. Four species of this genus are
  Malayan; one is West African.</p>

  <p>The Bornean <i>Rheithrosciurus macrotis</i> is the only species of its
  genus. The genus may be distinguished by the exceedingly brachyodont
  molars, this feature being more marked in this genus than in all other
  Squirrels. It is called the "Groove-toothed Squirrel," from the "seven to
  ten minute parallel vertical grooves running down the front face of its
  incisors."<a name="NtA_324" href="#Nt_324"><sup>[324]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The genus <i>Spermophilus</i> includes a large number (forty or so) of
  Palaearctic and Nearctic animals known as Sousliks. The ears are small;
  there are cheek pouches as in <i>Tamias</i>. The general aspect of the
  animal is like that of a Marmot, and they bridge over the exceedingly
  narrow gap which separates the Marmots from the true Squirrels.
  Anatomically the skull is like that of <!-- Page 465 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page465"></a>{465}</span><i>Arctomys</i>; the
  molars are five in the upper and four in the lower jaw. The caecum is
  relatively speaking very small; the measurements in a specimen of <i>S.
  tredecimlineatus</i>, dissected by Dr. Tullberg, were: small intestine,
  580 mm.; large intestine, 170 mm.; and caecum, 27 mm. In <i>Tamias</i>
  also the caecum is not greatly developed. These animals are burrowing in
  habit.</p>

  <p>The Prairie-dogs, genus <i>Cynomys</i>, of which the best-known
  species is perhaps <i>C. ludovicianus</i>, are very like the Squirrels,
  but they are not arboreal creatures; they live in burrows on the ground,
  as their vernacular name denotes. The genus is entirely North American,
  and four species have been differentiated.</p>

  <p>The Prairie-dog or Prairie-marmot is some 10 inches to one foot in
  length. The tail is no more than 2 inches. The ears are very small; the
  thumb is fully developed and bears a claw. The measurements of the
  various sections of the intestine are the following<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span>Small intestine, 860 mm.; large intestine, 690
  mm.; caecum, 75 mm. Thus the caecum is not large comparatively speaking.
  These animals dig burrows on grassy plains which they share with the
  Ground Owl (<i>Speotyto cunicularis</i>) and with Rattlesnakes, all three
  species appearing to live in perfect amity. Probably the Owls use the
  conveniently-constructed burrows, and the Rattlesnakes come there to look
  after the young of both.</p>

  <p>Closely allied to the last are the Marmots, genus <i>Arctomys</i>.
  They differ in the rudimentary character of the thumb and in the longer
  tail. The eyes and ears are small. The distribution of the genus is
  Nearctic and Palaearctic. There are ten species of <!-- Page 466 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page466"></a>{466}</span>the genus. The Alpine
  Marmot, <i>A. marmotta</i>, is familiar to most persons. The animal lives
  high up in the Alps, and when danger threatens it gives vent to a shrill
  whistle. It hibernates in the winter, and as many as ten to fifteen
  animals may be found closely packed together in a single, carefully-lined
  burrow.</p>

  <p>The only other European species is <i>A. bobac</i>, the Siberian
  Marmot, which occurs in the extreme east of Europe, and is also Asiatic.
  There are four North American species, including the Quebec Marmot, <i>A.
  monax</i>.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:41%;">
      <a href="images/234.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/234.jpg"

<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 234.&mdash;Flying Squirrel. <i>Pteromys alborufus.</i> × <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">5</span>.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Pteromys</i> (of which the proper name, antedating
  <i>Pteromys</i> by five years, appears to be <i>Petaurista</i>) is
  confined to the Oriental region, where there are a dozen species or so.
  The limbs are united by a parachute extending to the toes, and supported
  anteriorly by a cartilage attached to the wrists. There are also
  membranes anteriorly uniting the fore-limbs to the neck, and posteriorly
  uniting the hind-limbs to the root of the tail and a trifle beyond. The
  skull and the dental formula are as in Sciurus, but the pattern of the
  molars, which is much complicated, seems to argue a different mode of
  nutrition. There are twelve pairs of ribs. The large intestine (in <i>P.
  petaurista</i>) is very nearly as long as the small, and the caecum is
  also "colossal"; the measurements in an individual of the species named
  were: small intestine, 670 mm.; caecum, 320 mm.; large intestine, 650 mm.
  <!-- Page 467 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page467"></a>{467}</span>The caecum is disposed in a spiral. The
  teats are three pairs, non-inguinal in position.</p>

  <p>The size of these squirrels is 16 to 18 inches exclusive of the tail,
  which is longer. These animals can make an exceedingly long jump with the
  help of their flying membrane. Nearly eighty yards is the longest
  distance given for these aerial excursions. It is stated that they are
  able to steer themselves to some extent while in the air. As appears to
  be the case with so many Rodents, these animals feed largely upon beetles
  and other insects, besides bark, nuts, etc.</p>

  <p>The allied genus <i>Sciuropterus</i> has a much wider range. It
  extends into the Palaearctic region and into North America, besides being
  found in India. There is here no membrane reaching to the tail. The palms
  and soles are furry. The caecum is very much shorter, and so is the large
  intestine. The latter, in <i>S. volucella</i>, is not more than one-third
  of the length of the small intestine. In other features there are no
  remarkable differences in structure, save that the mammae, always three
  pairs, may be inguinal.</p>

  <p>Of the genus <i>Eupetaurus</i><a name="NtA_325"
  href="#Nt_325"><sup>[325]</sup></a> but a single species is known, which
  is limited to high altitudes at Gilgit and perhaps in Thibet. Its
  principal difference from the other genera of Flying Squirrels is that
  the molars are hypselodont instead of brachyodont. The interfemoral
  membrane is rudimentary or wanting. The one species is <i>E.
  cinereus</i>. It is thought to live "on rocks, perhaps among precipices."
  Dr. Tullberg attributes the hypselodont teeth to the fact that the mosses
  upon which it is believed to feed may have much sand and earth
  intermingled, which would naturally lead to a more rapid wearing away of
  the teeth, and hence a need for a good supply of dental tissue to meet
  this destruction.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Castoridae.</b>&mdash;This, the third family of the
  Sciuromorpha, contains but one genus, <i>Castor</i>, the Beaver, with at
  most two species, one North American, the other European. This large
  Rodent has small eyes and ears, as befits an aquatic animal, and the tail
  is exceedingly broad and covered with scales; the transverse processes of
  the caudal vertebrae, in order better to support the thick tissues lying
  outside them, are divided in the middle of the series into two. The
  hind-feet are much larger than the fore-feet, and are more webbed than in
  any other aquatic Rodent. <!-- Page 468 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page468"></a>{468}</span></p>

  <p>In the skull the infraorbital foramen is small as in Squirrels. The
  postorbital process has practically vanished. The four molars stand out
  laterally from the jaws. The incisors, as might be surmised from the
  habits, are particularly strong. The stomach has near the entrance of the
  oesophagus a glandular patch, which seems to be like that of the Wombat
  (see p. <a href="#page144">144</a>). In both sexes the cloaca is very
  distinct and comparatively deep.</p>

  <p>The two species of the genus are <i>C. canadensis</i> and <i>C.
  fiber</i>. The latter is of course the European species, which is now
  found in several of the large rivers of Europe, such as the Danube and
  the Rhone. But it is everywhere getting scarce, and limited to quite
  small and isolated colonies.</p>

  <p>In this country it is absolutely extinct and has been since before the
  historic period. There is apparently no documentary evidence of its
  survival down to this period. But the numerous names of places which are
  called from this animal illustrate its former prevalence. Examples of
  such names are Beverley in Yorkshire, and Barbourne or Beaverbourne in
  Worcestershire. In Wales, however, Beavers seem to have persisted longer.
  But they were rare in the Principality for a hundred years or so before
  the Norman Conquest. The king Howel Dda, who died in 948 <span
  class="sm">A.D.</span>, fixed the price of a Beaver skin at 120 pence,
  the skins of Stag, Wolf, and Fox being worth only 8 pence apiece. The
  Beaver was called by the Welsh "Llost-llyddan," which means "broad-tail."
  Its existence in the country is handed down in the name of
  Llyn-ar-afange, which means Beaver lake. The last positive record of the
  Beaver in Wales seems to be the statement of Giraldus Cambrensis that in
  1188 the animal was still to be found in the river Teivy in
  Cardiganshire. In Scotland the Beaver is said to have continued down to a
  later date. Ireland it never reached. The remains of this animal by their
  abundance show the former prevalence of <i>C. fiber</i> in this country.
  It is known from the fens of Cambridgeshire, and from superficial
  deposits elsewhere. The Thames formerly had its Beavers, and apparently
  it was widely spread through the country generally.</p>

  <p>The Beaver not only furnishes collars and cuffs for coats; it was
  used, as every one knows, to provide hats. But the usefulness of the
  animal by no means ended here in the eyes of our <!-- Page 469 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page469"></a>{469}</span>forefathers. The Rev.
  Edward Topsell observed that "for giving great ease unto the gowt the
  skinnes of beavers burned with drie oynions" are excellent. Castorein as
  a drug, if not in actual use, has quite recently been a part of the
  pharmacopoeia. It is derived from the anal glands common to this and
  other Rodents, and indeed many other mammals.</p>

  <p>A large extinct form of Beaver is <i>Trogontherium</i>,<a
  name="NtA_326" href="#Nt_326"><sup>[326]</sup></a> found in the
  "Forest-bed" of Cromer. The skull is about one-fourth longer than that of
  <i>Castor</i>. It has a less inflated bulla, and slightly more pronounced
  postorbital processes than <i>Castor</i>. The third molar (fourth
  grinding tooth) is relatively larger than in <i>Castor</i>, and has a
  rather more folded crown. The foramen magnum is more triangular.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Haplodontidae.</b>&mdash;A separate family seems to be
  required for the genus <i>Haplodon</i>, whose characters will therefore
  be merged with those of its family. It is to be distinguished from most
  other Squirrel-like creatures by the fact that there is no postorbital
  process to the frontal. The molar teeth are five in the upper and four in
  the lower jaw. The Sewellel, <i>H. rufus</i>, like the other species of
  the genus (<i>H. major</i>), is found in North America west of the Rocky
  Mountains. It has the habit of the Prairie-marmot, and has a short tail,
  only moderately long ears, and five-toed feet. Tullberg is of opinion
  that this animal nearly represents the ancestral form of the Squirrel
  tribe.</p>

<h5><span class="sc">Section 2. Myomorpha.</span></h5>

  <p>This subdivision of the Rodents contains, according to Mr. Thomas's
  recent estimate,<a name="NtA_327" href="#Nt_327"><sup>[327]</sup></a> no
  less than 102 genera. It is therefore obviously impossible to do more
  than refer to some of the more interesting of these. This group is again
  divided into the following families<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>(1) Gliridae, including the Dormice.</p>

  <p>(2) Muridae, the Rats, Mice, Gerbilles, Australian Water-rats,
  Hamster.</p>

  <p>(3) Bathyergidae, Cape Mole, etc.</p>

  <p>(4) Spalacidae, Bamboo Rats. <!-- Page 470 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page470"></a>{470}</span></p>

  <p>(5) Geomyidae, Pouched Rats.</p>

  <p>(6) Heteromyidae, Kangaroo Rats.</p>

  <p>(7) Dipodidae, Jerboas.</p>

  <p>(8) Pedetidae.</p>

  <p>The Gliridae have no caecum, so usual in the Rodentia. It is true that
  all the genera have not been dissected, but it is known that in the true
  Dormice, as well as in the genus <i>Platacanthomys</i>, a caecum is
  absent.</p>

  <p>Apart from these few exceptions the Mouse-like Rodents all possess a
  caecum, though it is often not very large. They are all smallish animals,
  and are modified to a great variety of habit and habitat. There are
  burrowing, swimming, and climbing forms. The group is universal in range,
  even including the Australian region, in which they are the only
  Rodents.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Gliridae.</b>&mdash;This family, also called Myoxidae,<a
  name="NtA_328" href="#Nt_328"><sup>[328]</sup></a> includes the Dormice,
  and is entirely an Old-World family, absent only from the Malagasy
  region. Its most important differential character is the total absence of
  the caecum and of any sharp boundary between the small and large
  intestine. The molars are usually four. The eyes and ears are well
  developed.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Muscardinus</i> includes only the Common Dormouse, <i>M.
  arellanarius</i>. This small creature, 3 inches long with a tail of 2½
  inches, is, of course, a well-known inhabitant of this country. It is
  also found all over Europe. It is not particularly abundant in this
  country, and a good specimen is said to be worth half a guinea. As the
  specific name denotes, it lives largely on hazel nuts; but it will also
  suck eggs and devour insects. The animal makes a "nest" in the form of a
  hollow ball. Its hibernation is well known, and has also given rise to
  the German name ("Schläfer") of the group. It was well known to
  Aristotle, who gave or adopted the name <span title="Eleios" class="grk"
  >&#x1F18;&lambda;&epsilon;&iota;&#x1F78;&sigmaf;</span> for the animal.
  Its winter sleep&mdash;suggestive of death&mdash;and its revivification
  in the spring gave the Bishop of Salamis, Epiphanius, an argument for the
  resurrection of man. The fur was reckoned in Pliny's time a remedy for
  paralysis and also for disease of the ears.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Myoxus</i> includes also but a single species, <i>M.
  glis</i>, the so-called "Fat Dormouse" of the Continent. It has no <!--
  Page 471 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page471"></a>{471}</span>glandular swelling at the base of the
  oesophagus, such as occurs in the last genus and in <i>Graphiurus</i>. Of
  <i>Graphiurus</i> there are thirteen species, all African in range. The
  genus does not differ widely from the last. There is, however, a
  glandular region of the oesophagus. <i>Eliomys</i> is the last genus of
  typical Dormice. It is Palaearctic in range.</p>

  <p><i>Platacanthomys</i>, of a Dormouse-like form, has like other Dormice
  a long tail, on which the long coarse hairs are arranged in two rows on
  opposite sides towards the tip; it is represented by a single species,
  <i>P. lasiurus</i>, from the Malabar coast. It is arboreal in habit. The
  fur is mingled with flattened spines. The molars are reduced to three on
  each side of each jaw. This form has been bandied about between the
  "Mice" and the "Dormice"; but Mr. Thomas's discovery of the absence of
  the caecum argues strongly in favour of its correct location among the
  Gliridae. <i>Typhlomys</i> is an allied genus, also from the Oriental
  region. This and the last are placed in a special sub-family of the
  Gliridae, Platacanthomyinae, by Mr. Thomas.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Muridae.</b>&mdash;This family, that of the Rats and Mice
  in a wide sense, is the most extensive family of Rodents. In it Mr.
  Thomas includes no less than seventy-six genera. The molars are generally
  three. The tail is fairly long, or very long, and the soles of the feet
  are naked.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 1. Murinae.</b>&mdash;The true Rats and Mice may be
  considered to form a sub-family, Murinae. The genus <i>Mus</i>, including
  the Rats and Mice in the limited sense of the word, contains about 130
  species. They are exclusively Old World in range, being only absent from
  the Island of Madagascar. In the New World there are no species of the
  restricted genus <i>Mus</i>. The eyes and the ears are large; the pollex
  is rudimentary, and bears a nail instead of a claw. The tail is largely
  scaly. All the members of the genus are small animals, some quite minute.
  In this country there are five species<a name="NtA_329"
  href="#Nt_329"><sup>[329]</sup></a> of the genus, viz. the Harvest Mouse,
  <i>M. minutus</i>, which has a body only 2½ inches long with an equally
  long tail. It is the smallest of British quadrupeds with the exception of
  the Lesser Shrew. The Wood Mouse, <i>M. sylvaticus</i>, is about twice
  the size; it differs also from the last species in that it <!-- Page 472
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page472"></a>{472}</span>frequents
  barns, and is thus sometimes mistaken for the Common Mouse, from which,
  however, it is to be distinguished by its coloration and longer ears. The
  latter, <i>M. musculus</i>, is too familiar to need much description. A
  curious variety of it has occurred. This has a thickened and a folded
  skin like that of a Rhinoceros, and the hair has disappeared. The Black
  Rat, <i>M. rattus</i>, is like a large Mouse, and is smaller and blacker
  in colour than the "Hanoverian Rat." It is sometimes called the "Old
  English Rat," but seems nevertheless to be not a truly indigenous Rodent.
  It has been so defeated by competition with the Hanoverian Rat that it is
  now not a common species in this country.</p>

  <p>The Hanoverian or Brown Rat, <i>M. decumanus</i>, is a larger and a
  browner animal than the last. It is very widely distributed through the
  globe, no doubt largely on account of the fact that it is readily
  transported by man. The same is the case with the Common Mouse, whose
  real origin must be a matter of doubt. The original home of the Brown Eat
  is thought by Dr. Blanford to be Mongolia. There is so far a
  justification for the name "Hanoverian Rat" that the animal seems to have
  reached this country about the year 1728. But there is no reason for
  calling it, as is sometimes done, the Norway Rat.</p>

  <p>Some members of this genus, whose fur is interspersed with spines, or
  which are quite spiny, have been separated as a genus, <i>Leggada</i>,
  which, however, is not generally allowed.</p>

  <p>Closely allied again is <i>Chiruromys</i>, which has a strongly
  prehensile tail, a feature which is not common among the Myomorpha,
  though <i>Dendromys</i>, a tree-frequenting form, and <i>Mus minutus</i>,
  already spoken of, show the same character. Many Mice seem to have
  prehensile tails, which they can curl round branches; but it is not so
  fully developed as in the species just named.</p>

  <p>A number of other genera are referable to the true Mice, the
  sub-family Murinae of Thomas's classification. The Syrian and African
  <i>Acomys</i> has very spiny fur, so much so that "when it has its spines
  erected it is almost indistinguishable at the first glance from a
  diminutive hedgehog." The genera <i>Cricetomys</i>, <i>Malacomys</i>,
  <i>Lophuromys</i>, <i>Saccostomus</i>, <i>Dasymys</i> are restricted to
  the Ethiopian region. <i>Nesokia</i> is Oriental, reaching <!-- Page 473
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page473"></a>{473}</span>also the
  Palaearctic region. <i>Vandeleuria</i>, <i>Chiropodomys</i>,
  <i>Batomys</i>, <i>Carpomys</i> are Oriental, the last two being confined
  to the Philippines.</p>

  <p>Another peculiar Philippine genus is <i>Phlaeomys</i>, of large size,
  and allied to it is <i>Crateromys</i>, originally confounded with it.
  <i>Batomys granti</i> is also confined to Luzon. Its molars are three,
  like those of the also restricted and Philippine <i>Carpomys
  melanurus</i>, which is an arboreal form. There is a second species,
  <i>C. phaeurus</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Phlaeomys</i> is placed, however, by Mr. Thomas in a distinct
  sub-family of its own, <b>Phlaeomyinae</b>, and is removed from the
  Murinae.</p>

  <p><i>Hapalomys</i>, with but one species, is Burmese.
  <i>Pithecochirus</i> is Javanese and Sumatran. <i>Conilurus</i> (also
  known as <i>Hapalotis</i>) is a genus containing species which are termed
  Jerboa Rats, on account of their mode of progression. They are desert and
  Australian forms. There are sixteen species.</p>

  </div>
<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 235.&mdash;Spiny Mouse. <i>Acomys cahirinus.</i> × ½.</p>

  <p><i>Mastacomys</i>, with one species, is limited to Tasmania.
  <i>Uromys</i>, with some eight species, is from Queensland, and inhabits
  also the Aru Islands and the Solomon Islands. The Celebesian
  <i>Echiothrix</i>, or <i>Craurothrix</i> as it should apparently properly
  be called, is another genus containing but a single species.
  <i>Golunda</i> is both Oriental and Ethiopian, one species occurring in
  each region. The beautiful little striped Barbary Mice,
  <i>Arviacanthis</i> (or <i>Isomys</i>), are African, north as well as
  tropical.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Saccostomus</i> resembles the Hamsters in the presence of
  cheek pouches. Its teeth, however, are Murine. It agrees with
  <i>Steatomys</i> in the comparatively short tail. The caecum is rather
  long. <!-- Page 474 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page474"></a>{474}</span></p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 2. Hydromyinae.</b>&mdash;The genus <i>Hydromys</i>,<a
  name="NtA_330" href="#Nt_330"><sup>[330]</sup></a> of which there are
  several species, the best known being <i>H. chrysogaster</i>, is an
  exclusively Australian form, and is aquatic in habit. It is a foot or so
  in length, and has a fairly long tail. The fore- and hind-limbs are
  webbed, in correspondence with its habits. The Australian Water-Rat is
  black, with an admixture of golden-coloured hairs dorsally and golden
  colour below, with a lighter median stripe. The thumb is small, and the
  webbing of the hands is not so marked as is that of the feet. The molars
  are only two in each half of each jaw. The caecum is rather small, the
  measurements of the alimentary canal being: small intestine, 895 mm.;
  large intestine, 278 mm.; caecum, 70 mm. Allied to the last is
  <i>Xeromys</i>, a genus which is also Australian, but limited to
  Queensland. It has been established by Mr. Thomas,<a name="NtA_331"
  href="#Nt_331"><sup>[331]</sup></a> who discovered that it has the same
  reduced formula as <i>Hydromys</i>. <i>Xeromys</i>, however, is not an
  aquatic animal, and has unwebbed feet.</p>

  <p>In the Luzon highlands Mr. Whitehead has discovered, and Mr. Thomas
  quite recently described,<a name="NtA_332"
  href="#Nt_332"><sup>[332]</sup></a> a number of peculiar Rodents. Of
  these the genera <i>Chrotomys</i>, <i>Celaenomys</i>, and <i>Crunomys</i>
  are allied to the Australian and New Guinea <i>Hydromys</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Chrotomys whiteheadi</i> is unusual among Muridae, in its
  coloration being marked by a pale stripe down the back. The creature is
  the size of the Black Rat (<i>Mus rattus</i>). It is terrestrial not
  aquatic in habit, in spite of its likeness to <i>Hydromys</i>. The
  molars, however, are 3/3.</p>

  <p><i>Crunomys fallax</i> is more like <i>Hydromys</i>. It has, however,
  three molars, as in the last genus. But the skull has the flattened form
  characteristic of <i>Hydromys</i> as opposed to <i>Mus</i>.</p>

  <p>Like <i>Batomys</i>, <i>Celaenomys silaceus</i> is also somewhat
  intermediate between <i>Hydromys</i> and <i>Mus</i>. It is described as
  very Shrew-like in appearance, and has a very pointed muzzle. Its habits
  Mr. Whitehead is "quite unable even to guess at." Like <i>Hydromys</i>
  and <i>Xeromys</i> this Rodent has but two molars.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 3. Rhynchomyinae.</b>&mdash;The genus <i>Rhynchomys</i>,
  containing but one species, <i>Rh. soricioides</i> (of Thomas), is also,
  as both its generic and specific names imply, a somewhat Shrew-like form
  in external aspect. The skull, too, is Insectivore-like in its <!-- Page
  475 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page475"></a>{475}</span>elongation, and the lower incisors are
  worn to needle-like points. The two molars are excessively minute, and
  thus the always large gap in the jaws is greatly exaggerated. It is
  suggested that this Rat is an insect-eater, but nothing positive is
  known.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 4. Gerbillinae.</b>&mdash;The Gerbilles form another
  sub-family, Gerbillinae, of the Muridae, or a family, according to some.
  The best-known genus is <i>Gerbillus</i>, including the Gerbilles proper.
  These animals are Old World in range, belonging to the three regions of
  that part of the world. There are a large number of species in the genus,
  over thirty. They have a Jerboa-like form, with rather long hind-limbs
  and a long and hairy tail. But the hind- as well as the fore-feet are
  five-toed. The molar teeth have no trace of tubercles, but only
  transverse lamellae of enamel. The incisors are orange; they are white in
  <i>Dipus</i>. <i>Gerbillus pyramidum</i> is 90 mm. long, with a tail of
  125 mm. The ears are long, 13 mm. The tail has longer hairs at the
  tip.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:40%;">
      <a href="images/236.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/236.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 236." title="Fig. 236." /></a>
  </div>
<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 236.&mdash;Gerbille. <i>Gerbillus aegyptius.</i> × ½.</p>

  <p><i>Psammomys</i> is in some respects different. The tail is shorter
  than in <i>Gerbillus</i>; its length in an individual of 165 mm. was 130
  mm. As in <i>Gerbillus</i> there are four pairs of teats, two pectoral
  and two inguinal. This genus is exclusively Palaearctic in range.
  <i>Meriones</i> has a range co-extensive with that of
  <i>Gerbillus</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Pachyuromys</i> is an Ethiopian genus with a short tail. As the
  generic name denotes, the tail is not only short but thick and
  fleshy.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 5. Otomyinae.</b>&mdash;The allied genera, <i>Otomys</i>
  and <i>Oreinomys</i>, are Ethiopian. <i>Otomys unisulcatus</i> has a tail
  shorter than the body, the measurements of a female of this species being
  137 mm. with a tail of 87 mm. The ear is long, whence the name; it
  measured in this specimen 20 mm. <!-- Page 476 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page476"></a>{476}</span></p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 6. Dendromyinae.</b>&mdash;The genus <i>Deomys</i> is an
  African form, consisting of only one species from the Congo region. <i>D.
  ferrugineus</i> has a reddish colour as its name implies; the soles are
  quite naked and the tail is long and slender. It is considerably longer
  than the body, measuring (minus a fragment of the tip) 172 mm., while the
  body is 125 mm. long. The characters of the molar teeth, which are three,
  are intermediate in their form between those of the true Rats and those
  of the Hamsters.</p>

  <p><i>Dendromys</i> is also Ethiopian in range. There are several
  species. <i>D. mesomelas</i> is a smallish creature, 60 mm. long, with a
  tail of 90 mm.</p>

  <p><i>Steatomys</i> is another African genus, allied to the last. Its
  tail, however, is only half the length of the body. The two remaining
  genera are <i>Malacothrix</i> and <i>Limacomys</i>. Their range is
  African.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 7. Lophiomyinae.</b>&mdash;Allied to the Hamsters is the
  singular East African genus <i>Lophiomys</i>, with only one species,
  <i>L. imhausi</i>, of Milne-Edwards.<a name="NtA_333"
  href="#Nt_333"><sup>[333]</sup></a> The size is between that of a Rabbit
  and of a Guinea-pig. The stomach is curved and somewhat intestiniform. It
  has been termed the Crested Rat on account of the "prominent crest of
  stiff hair running down the back." The fingers and toes are five, and the
  very long tail is clad with hair longer than that upon the body
  generally. The pollex is rudimentary, and the hallux is opposable.</p>

  <p>The most remarkable structural feature in this genus concerns the
  skull, and on account of this it has been regarded as the type of a
  separate family. The temporal fossa behind the eye is covered over by a
  complete bony plate, formed by a downgrowth of the parietal, meeting an
  upgrowth from the malar; this singular arrangement of the bones recalls
  the conditions which obtain in turtles. The whole skull, moreover, is
  covered with symmetrically disposed granulations, such as are found in no
  other mammal; it suggests rather the skull of certain fish. It is
  believed that the bony plate already referred to is not really a portion
  of the bones of which it appears to be a prolongation, but merely an
  ossification of fasciae in this region. The atlas is granulated like the
  skull; there are sixteen pairs of ribs and a feeble clavicle. The molars
  are three, and of a peculiar form. <!-- Page 477 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page477"></a>{477}</span>They have, in the case
  of the first three, transverse ridges, from which stand up two sharp and
  long tubercles. The other teeth have two ridges. The incisors are pale
  yellow. The shape of the teeth and the smallness of the caecum suggest
  that this Rodent is not so purely a vegetarian as others, and that it
  nourishes itself largely upon insects.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 8. Microtinae.</b>&mdash;The Voles or Water-Rats form a
  distinct group of Murine animals, to which the sub-family name of
  Microtinae has been applied from the genus <i>Microtus</i> (more
  generally known as <i>Arvicola</i>), a genus which includes the Water-Rat
  and Field-Voles of this country. This genus has short ears, and a short
  and hairy tail. Its build is stouter and clumsier than that of the Rats.
  The genus is confined to the Palaearctic and the Nearctic regions. In
  this country there are three species. The best known is the Water-Vole or
  Water-Rat, <i>M. amphibius</i>, which has been seen by most people, and
  which frequents streams, ponds, and canals. The feet, curiously enough,
  are not webbed, which seems to argue the recent adoption of an aquatic
  life. Mr. Trevor-Battye has remarked that this animal, when swimming at
  leisure, uses its hind-limbs only, carrying the fore pair at the sides
  like a Seal. The Bank-Vole, <i>M. glareolus</i>, is rather a local
  species in this country. It is a terrestrial Vole, and burrows. The
  Field-Vole, <i>M. agrestis</i>, has become notorious on account of the
  "plagues," to which its immense numbers have on occasions given rise. It
  is the smallest species, and has a greyish-brown fur like the Water-Vole,
  the Bank-Vole being redder. To give an idea of the cost of the
  depredations of this animal, Mr. Scherren quotes<a name="NtA_334"
  href="#Nt_334"><sup>[334]</sup></a> a farmer who gave evidence before the
  Agricultural Commission to the effect that, putting the damage of one
  Vole at two pence, the amount of loss suffered on a farm of 6500 acres in
  two years would be £50,000!</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Fiber</i> comes very near the last. It is a North
  American genus. The hind-feet are slightly webbed; the tail is a trifle
  shorter than the body, and is compressed and scaly, with scattered hairs.
  The thumb is short, but with a fully-developed claw. As in the last
  genus, the small and large intestines are roughly of the same length, and
  the caecum is about one-fourth of the length of either. It is known as
  the "Musquash." <!-- Page 478 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page478"></a>{478}</span></p>

  <p>Of <i>Fiber zibethicus</i>, or rather a closely-allied form, <i>F.
  osoyoosensis</i>, from Lake Osoyoos near the Rockies, Mr. Lord writes<a
  name="NtA_335" href="#Nt_335"><sup>[335]</sup></a> that it constructs for
  itself a house of bulrushes built up from the bottom in 3 or 4 feet of
  water. It is dome-shaped, and rises about a foot out of the water. "If a
  dead or badly-wounded duck be left on the pool, it is at once seized on,
  towed into the house, and doomed." Thus it appears that this Rodent, like
  so many others, is largely carnivorous. It has also been asserted that it
  eats fish.</p>

  <p><i>Neofiber</i> is an allied genus, North American in range. The
  species, <i>N. alleni</i>, is compared, as regards outward form, with the
  Water-Vole, <i>M. amphibius</i>. It has, however, a shorter tail.</p>

  <p>Another very well-known member of this sub-family is the Lemming. The
  name, however, applies to two quite distinct genera. The genus
  <i>Cuniculus</i>, including the Banded Lemming, <i>C. torquatus</i>, is
  an inhabitant of North America, Siberia, and Greenland. The tail is
  short, its length being 12 mm. as against a body length of 101 mm. The
  feet are furred beneath, a not unusual state of affairs in Arctic
  mammals. The ears are very slight. The thumb is well developed, and bears
  a claw.</p>

  <p>In <i>Myodes</i>, on the other hand, which is not so markedly an
  Arctic animal, though occurring in both Palaearctic and Nearctic regions,
  the ears are rather bigger, though still smaller than those of
  <i>Microtus</i>. The under surfaces of the feet are similarly furred. The
  tail is also short. It is commonly said that the two genera are to be
  distinguished by the furred feet of <i>Cuniculus</i>, and by the absence
  of fur in the present genus. That, according to Tullberg, does not appear
  to be the case. The differences are thus so much reduced that it seems
  almost unnecessary to retain the two genera. The best known species of
  <i>Myodes</i> is of course the Scandinavian Lemming, <i>M. lemmus</i>.
  This animal used to occur in this country in Pleistocene times (as did
  also <i>C. torquatus</i>), and recently Dr. Gadow has found remains with
  skins attached in caves in Portugal. It may still survive in the
  mountains of the Peninsula.</p>

  <p>The actual habitat of the Lemming in Scandinavia is the great
  tablelands, 3000 feet high in the centre. The migrations do not take
  place with regularity; even twenty years may elapse before the appearance
  in cultivated lands of those countless <!-- Page 479 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page479"></a>{479}</span>hordes so familiar (as
  far as their description is concerned) to everybody. The Lemmings do not
  return from their exodus. They die from various causes, including combats
  with one another. Their chief foes, however, are Wolves and Gluttons,
  Buzzards and Ravens, Owls and Skuas, which batten on the migrant hordes.
  Their sudden increase in numbers recalls the similar increase at times of
  the Field-Vole, to which reference has already been made.</p>

  <p><i>Ellobius</i> is an Old-World genus, which leads a "Talpine" life,
  and has in consequence rudimentary external ears and very small eyes. The
  tail is short. Contrary to what might be expected from its mode of life,
  the claws upon the digits are not strong.</p>

  <p>The remaining genera of Vole-like Murines are <i>Phenacomys</i> and
  <i>Synaptomys</i> from North America, and Siphneus from Palaearctic Asia.
  <i>Evotomys</i> is one of those genera which are common to both the
  Palaearctic and the Nearctic regions, but the bulk of the species are
  North American.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 9. Sigmodontinae.</b>&mdash;This is the name given to
  another sub-family of Murine Rodents, a group which includes the Hamsters
  in the Old World as well as a large number of South American genera of
  Rat-like animals. Of these latter there are a very large number, the bulk
  of the group being American.</p>

  <p>The Hamsters, genus <i>Cricetus</i>, as it is usually called, although
  apparently the correct name is Hamster, are Old-World forms of Pouched
  Rats. The Common Hamster, <i>C. frumentarius</i>, is about 210 mm. long,
  with a tail of 58 mm. It has cheek pouches. The small and the large
  intestines are not very unequal in length, and the caecum is fairly
  large, being about one-sixth to one-seventh of the length of either. It
  is a purely vegetable-feeding creature, and in Germany where it occurs
  (and from which language its vernacular name is derived), hibernates
  during the winter in its burrow, having previously surrounded itself with
  a great accumulation of food carried thither.</p>

  <p>To North America are peculiar the genera <i>Onychomys</i>,
  <i>Sigmodon</i>, and <i>Peromyscus</i>. The genus <i>Sigmodon</i>, the
  Cotton Rats, reaches Central America, and even gets a little farther
  south. The other two genera, though mainly North American, also extend
  their range to the south. <i>Onychomys</i> has hairy <!-- Page 480
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page480"></a>{480}</span>foot-pads, a
  state of affairs which characterises a number of these Rodents.</p>

  <p>The genera <i>Megalomys</i>, <i>Chilomys</i>, <i>Reithrodontomys</i>,
  <i>Eligmodontia</i>, <i>Nectomys</i>, <i>Rhipidomys</i>, <i>Tylomys</i>,
  <i>Holochilus</i>, <i>Reithrodon</i>, <i>Phyllotis</i>,
  <i>Scapteromys</i>, <i>Acodon</i>, <i>Oxymycterus</i>, <i>Ichthyomys</i>,
  <i>Blarinomys</i>, <i>Notiomys</i> are South American forms.
  <i>Oryzomys</i> and <i>Rheithrodontomys</i> are common to both parts of
  the New World.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Ichthyomys</i> is remarkable on account of its
  un-Rodent-like habits and of certain associated structural changes. <i>I.
  stolzmanni</i> was obtained from Mount Chanchamays in Peru at an altitude
  of 3000 feet; it is a habitual fish-eater, and lives in streams. Another
  species, <i>I. hydrobates</i>, was formerly referred to
  <i>Habrothrix</i>. The skull shows likenesses to that of the Australian
  <i>Hydromys</i>; but the most marked characters of adaptation are those
  of the teeth and caecum. The cutting edges of the upper incisors form a
  reversed <img src="images/v.png" class="middle" style="height:2ex;" alt="V"
  /> of obvious use in holding a slippery fish. The caecum is much reduced,
  short, and narrow. The general Otter-like shape of the creature is
  largely due to its flattened head, though its "size and general
  proportions are much as in the common Black Rat."<a name="NtA_336"
  href="#Nt_336"><sup>[336]</sup></a></p>

  <p>This sub-family contains a number of genera from Madagascar, viz.
  <i>Brachytarsomys</i>, <i>Nesomys</i>, <i>Hallomys</i>,
  <i>Brachyuromys</i>, <i>Hypogeomys</i>, <i>Gymnuromys</i>, and
  <i>Eliurus</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 10. Neotominae.</b>&mdash;The last sub-family of the
  Muridae is that of the Neotominae, containing the North American genera
  <i>Neotoma</i>, <i>Xenomys</i>, <i>Hodomys</i>, and <i>Nelsonia</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Bathyergidae.</b>&mdash;This family contains several genera
  which consist of subterranean forms. All these Rodents agree in a number
  of characters, of which the principal are as follows<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>The eyes are very small, and the external ears are reduced to the
  merest fringe of skin round the aural aperture. The legs are short, as is
  the tail; the hair-covering is reduced&mdash;a reduction which finds its
  culmination in the nearly nude <i>Heterocephalus</i>. Being burrowing
  creatures, a number of other modifications in accordance with this mode
  of life are to be seen in their structure. The upper incisors stand out
  in front of the closed lips, and prevent the entrance of earth. For the
  same reason <!-- Page 481 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page481"></a>{481}</span>the nostrils are small, and the forehead
  but little expanded between them.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Bathyergus</i> contains but a single species, the Cape
  Mole-Rat, which is found in Southern Africa; it is of moderate size, not
  exceeding a small Rabbit in dimensions. On the fore-limbs are exceedingly
  long claws, of which that borne by the second finger is the longest, and
  the claw of the thumb the shortest. The hind-feet have by no means such
  long claws. The scratching and burrowing is naturally chiefly effected by
  the fore-limbs. The small and large intestines are of equal length, and
  each is rather more than six times the length of the caecum; in these
  measurements the present genus differs from the next.</p>

  <p><i>Georhychus.</i>&mdash;Of this African genus there are about ten
  species. The claws are not so long as in the last genus, but there are,
  as in <i>Bathyergus</i>, four molar teeth on each half of each jaw. The
  intestinal measurements in an example of <i>G. capensis</i> were: small
  intestine, 25 inches; caecum, 4 inches; large intestine, 15 inches.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Myoscalops</i> or <i>Heliphohius</i> (also with an
  African range) has six back teeth on each side. A number of species
  sometimes referred to the last genus are placed here by Mr. Thomas. The
  claws are small.</p>

  <p>One of the most remarkable genera of this family is the little
  <i>Heterocephalus</i> from Abyssinia and Somaliland. As Mr. Thomas justly
  remarks,<a name="NtA_337" href="#Nt_337"><sup>[337]</sup></a> it "is a
  peculiar-looking little creature, about the size of the Common Mouse, but
  looking almost more like a tiny hairless puppy on account of its nearly
  naked skin, small eyes, and peculiar physiognomy." Though apparently
  naked, there are numerous scattered hairs over the entire body, and the
  toes are fringed with stiffish hairs, which must be advantageous to a
  burrowing animal. There are two species, <i>H. glaber</i> (originally
  described by Rüppell), and <i>H. phillipsii</i>, of which our knowledge
  is due to Mr. Thomas. The length of the entire creature including the
  tail is not more than 134 mm., both species being approximately of the
  same dimensions. Mr. Lort Phillips, the discoverer of the species which
  bears his name, writes "that this little creature, called 'Farumfer' by
  the Somali, throws up in places groups of miniature craters, which
  exactly resemble volcanoes in active eruption. When the little beasts
  were at <!-- Page 482 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page482"></a>{482}</span>work, I used frequently to watch them, and
  found that the loose earth from their excavations was brought to the
  bottom of the crater, and sent with great force into the air in a
  succession of rapid jerks, and that they themselves never ventured forth
  from the shelter of the burrows."<a name="NtA_338"

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Spalacidae.</b>&mdash;"The Spalacidae," observes Dr.
  Blanford, "are sometimes called rodent moles, and resemble a mole in
  general aspect, having cylindrical bodies, short limbs, small eyes and
  ears, large claws, and a short or rudimentary tail." The existence of a
  spiral valve in the caecum may perhaps characterise this family; but it
  has at present only been found in the two genera <i>Spalax</i> and
  <i>Rhizomys</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Spalax</i> has inconspicuous eyes and external ears. The tail is
  totally absent. The lower incisors are more developed than in other
  Rodents; they project in a bony sheath beyond the posterior end of the
  ramus of the lower jaw. The scapula is long and narrow. The large
  intestine is half the length of the small intestine. The animal seems to
  have only two pairs of teats, one pectoral the other inguinal.</p>

  <p><i>Spalax typhlus</i> of Egypt, which is probably not different from
  the European form, makes extensive burrows, some of the branches being
  even 30 to 40 yards in length. In a "domical chamber," situated along the
  course of one of these burrows, Dr. Anderson found no less than 68 bulbs
  stored up. Its eyes are mere black specks among the muscles, but they
  appear, however, to have a proper organisation. There are altogether
  eight species of the genus, which is entirely Palaearctic in its
  range.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Rhizomys</i>, including a number of species known as
  Bamboo Rats, is purely Oriental in range. <i>Rh. sumatrensis</i> reaches
  a length of 19 inches; the better-known species, <i>Rh. badius</i>, is at
  most only 9 inches in length&mdash;in both cases the measurements are
  exclusive of the tail, which is a quarter to one-third of the length of
  the body, and is not scaly but nearly naked, with a few scattered hairs.
  The molars are three, and the incisors usually orange in colour; but
  sometimes the upper incisors are white as in <i>Rh. badius</i>. There are
  thirteen dorsal vertebrae. In <i>Rh. pruinosus</i> the large intestine is
  considerably longer than the small intestine; the lengths of the two
  sections of the gut are 42 and 30 inches respectively. In another <!--
  Page 483 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page483"></a>{483}</span>species the large intestine is slightly
  shorter than the small intestine. In <i>Rh. badius</i> the two parts of
  the gut are almost exactly equal in length. There are three pairs of
  inguinal and two pairs of pectoral teats. The name <i>Rhizomys</i>
  appears to have been given to the animals of this genus for the reason
  that they feed largely on roots. They burrow, and, like many other
  burrowing animals, feed in the evening. As is the case with other forms,
  <i>Rhizomys</i> is said to burrow with the assistance of its teeth as
  well as of its claws.</p>

  <p><i>Tachyoryctes</i> is an African genus closely allied to the last.
  There are three Ethiopian species. It is mainly to be distinguished by
  the different pattern upon the grinding surface of the molars.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 5. Geomyidae.</b>&mdash;This family of burrowing Rodents is
  limited to North and Central America. The animals have cheek pouches, and
  small eyes and ears, in accordance with their mode of life. The claws of
  the fore-limbs are very strongly developed.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Geomys</i> contains some eight species, which are Central
  and North American, not extending, however, far north. The incisors of
  the upper jaw are grooved with two grooves. There are three pairs of
  teats&mdash;one axillary, and the two remaining inguinal.</p>

  <p><i>Thomomys</i>, without grooves on the incisors, reaches to Canada in
  the north, and does not extend as far south as the last genus. <!-- Page
  484 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page484"></a>{484}</span></p>

  <p>Allied to this family, and indeed united with it by Tullberg, but kept
  separate by Thomas, is the</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 6. Heteromyidae.</b>&mdash;The members of this family are also
  American, but are not confined to the northern-central regions of that
  continent, for the genus <i>Heteromys</i> extends into South America.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Dipodomys</i>, with twelve species, is of a Jerboa-like
  form, as the following measurements of an example of <i>D. merriami</i>
  will show. The length of the head and body was 85 mm.; of the tail 127
  mm.; the hind-foot is 32 mm. It has but four toes. The hind-limb is
  longer than the front-limbs.</p>

  <p>In <i>Perodipus</i> the same form is exhibited. There are, however,
  five toes, and the sole of the foot is hairy. The axis vertebra and the
  two following vertebrae are fused together.</p>

  <p><i>Perognathus</i> is a third genus. It has the same general slender
  form, but the tail is not so long, being but little longer than the body.
  The hind-limbs, too, are shorter. The teats of this and of
  <i>Perodipus</i> are as in <i>Geomys</i>. The two remaining genera of the
  family are <i>Heteromys</i> and <i>Microdipodops</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 7. Dipodidae.</b>&mdash;This family consists of small,
  plain-living, and leaping or arboreal creatures, commonly known as
  Jerboas. The main anatomical characters of the family are the
  following<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span>There is a large infra-orbital
  foramen. The molars are always reduced, the premolar being either absent
  in the lower jaw alone or in both jaws. This family presents an obvious

  other members of the American family Heteromyidae <!-- Page 485 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page485"></a>{485}</span>There is even the same

Flower's <i>Osteology</i>.)</p>

  <p>The typical genus <i>Dipus</i> is a smallish quadruped with long naked
  ears and a long tail. The ten species are all Palaearctic in range. The
  fore-limbs are short and five fingered, and the short pollex has no claw;
  the hind-limbs are excessively long and only three-toed. The bony
  structure of these limbs is remarkable. The three metatarsals are
  elongated almost like those of a bird, and are ankylosed together. The
  digits have long phalanges which alone reach the ground as the animal
  hops. It is a curious fact, and one not so easily identifiable with the
  way of life, that the neck vertebrae of this genus are ankylosed together
  with the exception of the atlas, which is free; the arrangement is
  precisely like that of the Sperm Whale. The last vertebra is, however,
  sometimes free. The Jerboas not only leap but they burrow, and their
  strong incisors are said to be used in burrowing through stony ground.
  They are eaten by the Arabs, and are, or have been, called Daman Israel,
  <i>i.e.</i> Lamb of Israel. In <i>D. hirtipes</i> the body and tail
  measure respectively 4½ and 7 inches. The hind-feet have a tuft of long
  hairs below. Mr. W. L. Sclater's newly-founded genus <i>Euchoreutes</i><a
  name="NtA_339" href="#Nt_339"><sup>[339]</sup></a> is somewhat more
  primitive in its characters than is <i>Dipus</i>. The general form is the
  same, with long ears and a long tail. But there are five toes to the
  hind-limb, the two lateral ones though nailed being much shorter than the
  middle three. It has a "long pig-like snout," and the tail is cylindrical
  as in most other Jerboas, with a tuft of longer hairs at the end. The
  incisor teeth, grooved in <i>Dipus</i>, are here smooth, as in
  <i>Alactaga</i>. The species was probably obtained "in the sandy plains
  round the city of Yarkand." <!-- Page 486 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page486"></a>{486}</span></p>

  <p><i>Alactaga</i> is much like <i>Euchoreutes</i>; it has five toes, a
  cylindrical tufted tail, the hairs at the end distichous, smooth
  incisors, and a premolar present in the upper jaw. It also differs from
  <i>Euchoreutes</i> by the much smaller auditory bulla as well as in the
  fact that the infra-orbital foramen has no separate passage for the
  nerve, which passage is to be distinguished in both <i>Dipus</i> and
  <i>Euchoreutes</i>. The best-known species is the Siberian Jumping
  Rabbit, <i>A. jaculus</i>. Beneath the ends of the three main toes of the
  feet are remarkable fan-shaped pads. In <i>A. decumana</i> the body and
  tail measure 7 and 10 inches respectively, the ears 2 inches.
  <i>Platycercomys</i>, a fourth genus of the family, is much less known
  and is to be differentiated from the last three genera by the fact that
  it has no premolars at all, the grinding tooth formula being thus 3/3.
  The tail too is flattened and "lancet shaped." It extends from Siberia to
  Nubia, and thus just enters the Ethiopian region.</p>

  <p>The above are the more typical Jerboas. There remain several forms
  which are not at all Jerboa-like in their way of life, but are
  nevertheless, on anatomical grounds, placed with them. <i>Zapus</i>, an
  American genus, with the exception of one Palaearctic species, is
  transitional in that its hind-legs are rather long, but there is not so
  much difference between them as in the typical Dipodidae. <i>Sminthus</i>
  is at the opposite extreme to <i>Dipus</i>. Its feet are short and of
  equal length; it climbs in trees, and may perhaps be looked upon as
  nearest of all Dipodidae to the ancestral form of the group.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 8. Pedetidae.</b>&mdash;The genus <i>Pedetes</i> contains but
  one species, <i>P. caffer</i>, the Cape Jumping Hare. The animal suggests
  a large Jerboa in appearance on account of its jumping habits, the long
  hind-limbs, and the long tail. The length of a fair-sized example is some
  17 inches, with a tail of the same length. The eyes and ears are large.
  The hands are five-fingered and the feet only four-toed, the hallux being
  of course the absent digit. In the skeleton it is interesting to note
  that the second and third cervical vertebrae are so close together that
  there can be no free movement; interesting because in <i>Dipus</i> the
  cervicals are actually ankylosed. The dorsal vertebrae are twelve. The
  small intestine is long, measuring 7 feet 4 inches, while the caecum is
  short, being only 8 inches long. The large intestine is 3 feet 10 inches
  long. The gall-bladder appears to be <!-- Page 487 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page487"></a>{487}</span>absent,<a
  name="NtA_340" href="#Nt_340"><sup>[340]</sup></a> an exceptional state
  of affairs in Rodents. A singular fact in the anatomy of this animal is
  the existence of a septum dividing the lower part of the trachea. This is
  sometimes met with in birds. As might be supposed from its large eyes,
  the Spring Haas, as the animal is sometimes called, is nocturnal. Its
  long hind-limbs permit it to leap enormous distances. It is a burrowing
  Rodent.</p>

<h5><span class="sc">Section 3. Hystricomorpha.</span></h5>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Octodontidae.</b>&mdash;The Rodents of this family are of
  small to moderate size, the only, relatively speaking, giant in the
  family being the "Water-Rat," <i>Myocastor</i>. The toes are with but one
  exception not reduced; the tail is long in the majority of the genera.
  The teats are placed high up on the sides of the body. The clavicle is
  fully ossified. All the genera are South or Central American in range
  with the exception of <i>Petromys</i>.<a name="NtA_341"
  href="#Nt_341"><sup>[341]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 1. Octodontinae.</b>&mdash;<i>Octodon</i> has four
  species, which are all Chilian, Peruvian, and Bolivian in distribution.
  The Degu, <i>O. degus</i>, has a length of 160 mm., with a tail 105 mm.
  long. The ears are 18 mm. long. At the roots of the claws are longish and
  stiff hairs which appear to serve as "combs." The tail has long but
  sparsely scattered hairs. There are twelve pairs of ribs. The lengths of
  the various sections of the intestine are as follows: small intestine,
  680 mm.; caecum, 90 mm.; large intestine, 390 mm. These animals live in
  large companies. Closely allied is the genus <i>Habrocoma</i> (more
  correctly, as it appears, to be written <i>Abrocoma</i>), with two
  species. <i>H. bennetti</i> is 204 mm. long, with a tail of 103 mm. The
  ears are long, 22 mm. The fore-feet have no outward trace of the thumb.
  Stiff hairs like those that characterise <i>Octodon</i> are found also in
  this genus. The fur is very soft. The furring of the tail is much thicker
  than in <i>Octodon</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Spalacopus</i> with but a single species, <i>S. poeppigi</i>, is a
  burrowing animal, from which indeed, and on account of its resemblance to
  <i>Spalax</i>, it has received its name. The ears in accordance with the
  underground life are short, only 5 mm. in length in an <!-- Page 488
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page488"></a>{488}</span>example of 120
  mm. The tail too is reduced, being in the same example only 42 mm. in
  length. As in the last two genera the large intestine is about one half
  of the length of the small intestine.</p>

  <p>The "Tuco-tuco," genus <i>Ctenomys</i>, has also short ears and tail.
  The claws of the fore-feet are longer than those of the hind-feet.</p>

  <p>A related form is <i>Aconaemys</i> (better known as <i>Schizodon</i>),
  with similar external characters; it inhabits high localities on the
  Andes.</p>

  <p><i>Petromys</i> is the only genus of the sub-family which is not
  American in habitat. It is an African form and there is but one species.
  Its anatomy conforms to that of the genera already considered. The main
  difference in structure is shown by the teeth. Their surface is uneven,
  and differs from that of other Hystricomorphs "in that the enamel to the
  inside of each upper jaw-tooth and outside on each lower jaw-tooth forms
  two tubercles, to which correspond grooves in the reverse position of the
  applied teeth."</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 2. Loncherinae.</b>&mdash;The genus <i>Echinomys</i> with
  thirteen species belongs to the Neotropical region. The members of the
  genus are entitled "Spiny Rats" since they have spines mixed with the
  fur. The tail is long and the ears are very well developed. Both feet are
  five-toed. The tail is scaly as well as haired. <i>Trichomys</i> (also
  called <i>Nelomys</i>) is very close to the above, and is also from the
  same part of the world.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Cannabateomys</i> contains but one species, <i>C.
  amblyonyx</i>, which was formerly included in the genus
  <i>Dactylomys</i>, but has lately been separated by Dr. Jentink.<a
  name="NtA_342" href="#Nt_342"><sup>[342]</sup></a> The animal is
  Brazilian and has a total length of 520 mm., of which 320 mm. belong to
  the tail. It is a climbing rat, and in accordance with that way of life
  has undergone some modifications. The fore-feet are four-toed, the two
  middle toes being markedly longer than the outer ones. The hind-feet are
  five-toed with the same greater development of the two middle toes. The
  claws are small and somewhat nail-like.</p>

  <p><i>Dactylomys</i>, also Brazilian, and with but one species, <i>D.
  dactylinus</i>, differs from the last in the fact that the molars are
  simpler in form; they are divided into two lobes, each of which <!-- Page
  489 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page489"></a>{489}</span>has but a
  single enamel fold, whereas in <i>Cannabateomys</i> these teeth have
  several enamel folds. The tail, moreover, is but slightly hairy.</p>

  <p><i>Loncheres</i> with eighteen species is another Neotropical genus
  allied to the foregoing. Small spines are, as in many of these genera,
  intermingled with the fur. This genus has as many as seventeen dorsal
  vertebrae, which is an unusually large number. <i>L. guianae</i> is known
  as the "Porcupine Rat." Allied genera, also South American, and without
  spines in their fur, are <i>Mesomys</i>, <i>Cercomys</i>, and
  <i>Carterodon</i>.</p>

  <p>The South American <i>Thrinacodus</i> is also known by one species,<a
  name="NtA_343" href="#Nt_343"><sup>[343]</sup></a> <i>T. albicauda</i>,
  which has rather more than the distal half of the long tail of a white
  colour. The fore-feet have four toes. The ears are broad and short.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 3. Capromyinae.</b>&mdash;A third sub-family of the
  Octodontidae is formed by the genera <i>Myocastor</i>, <i>Capromys</i>,
  <i>Plagiodontia</i>, and <i>Thrynomys</i>, which are all Neotropical
  forms with the exception of the last, which is African.</p>

  <p><i>Thrynomys</i> (better known perhaps as <i>Aulacodus</i>) is a genus
  of African Rodent, containing some four species. The best-known of these
  is <i>T. swindernianus</i>, the Ground-Rat of West and South Africa. Its
  structure has been investigated by Garrod,<a name="NtA_344"
  href="#Nt_344"><sup>[344]</sup></a> by Tullberg,<a name="NtA_345"
  href="#Nt_345"><sup>[345]</sup></a> and by myself.<a name="NtA_346"
  href="#Nt_346"><sup>[346]</sup></a> The fur is mingled with flattish
  bristles; the tail is moderately long, about half as long as the body.
  The fore-feet are five-toed, but the two toes at each end of the series
  are quite small. The hind-feet are only four-toed, the hallux being
  absent. The claws of the hind-feet are stronger than those of the
  fore-feet. The ears are not long. The limbs are decidedly short, hence
  the name of "Ground-Pig" sometimes applied to this animal. The molars are
  four in number in both jaws. The incisors of the upper jaw are twice
  grooved. There are thirteen dorsal vertebrae. The length of the small
  intestine is 60½ inches, that of the large 49; the caecum is short, being
  only 8 inches long. It is a remarkable fact that the acromion is joined
  to the rest of the spine of the scapula by a joint.</p>

  <p><i>Myocastor</i>, a name which seems to have the rights of priority
  over the more familiar <i>Myopotamus</i>, applies to a large South
  American aquatic Rodent. The general aspect of the animal <!-- Page 490
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page490"></a>{490}</span>suggests a
  Water-Rat of large size (it has been exhibited in shows as a phenomenal
  product of London sewers!); the tail is nearly as long as the body. The
  ears are small. The limbs are short. The tail is naked. The hind-feet are
  webbed, but not so much so as in <i>Hydromys</i>. A small thumb is
  present. The animal has thirteen pairs of ribs; the molars are four in
  each jaw. The large intestine is more than three times the length of the
  small, and the caecum is, as in the last genus, relatively short.</p>

  <p><i>Capromys</i> is a genus<a name="NtA_347"
  href="#Nt_347"><sup>[347]</sup></a> which is remarkable on account of its
  restricted distribution. It is found only in the islands of Cuba and
  Jamaica. There are four species, of which <i>C. melanurus</i> is a dark
  brown-coloured animal with a blacker tail, nearly as large as a Rabbit.
  The native name of this Rodent is "<i>hutia</i>." It is also remarkable
  for having a stomach more complicated than is the rule among the mammals
  of this group. The organ is divided by two constrictions into three
  compartments. In <i>C. pilorides</i> the liver is occasionally divided up
  in an extraordinary fashion into small lobules. <i>Capromys</i> has the
  large number of sixteen dorsal vertebrae.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Ctenodactylidae.</b>&mdash;For these African genera it
  seems admissible to form a distinct family, though Thomas, and Flower and
  Lydekker, only allow to the genera <i>Ctenodactylus</i>,
  <i>Pectinator</i>, and <i>Massoutiera</i> sub-family rank. On the other
  hand, Tullberg removed these genera entirely from the Hystricomorph
  section and placed them as a section of the sub-tribe Myomorphi of the
  tribe Sciurognathi. It was chiefly the form of the mandible which led to
  this placing, for in these Rodents, as in all Squirrel- and Rat-like
  Rodents, and unlike what is found in the Hystriciform genera, the angular
  process of the mandible is not bent sideways.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Ctenodactylus</i> derives its name from the peculiar
  strong bristles which form a comb-like structure upon the hind-feet and
  hide the claws; these are stated to be for the purpose of dressing the
  fur. The Gundi of North Africa, <i>C. gundi</i>, has a length of 190 mm.,
  with a short tail of 17 mm. The ears are only moderate in size. The
  dental formula of the molars is 4/3. The incisors are white. The feet
  have four digits, and the hind-limbs are the longer. The large intestine
  is distinctly longer than the small intestine. <!-- Page 491 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page491"></a>{491}</span></p>

  <p><i>Pectinator spekii</i> is the only representative of a genus not far
  removed from <i>Ctenodactylus</i>; it is a smallish Rodent, 6 inches in
  length, exclusive of a rather bushy tail nearly 3 inches long. It comes
  from Abyssinia. It has somewhat the appearance of a Squirrel, which is
  heightened by the fact that when sitting the tail is arched over the
  back; when running the tail is carried out straight. There are only four
  toes visible externally on both fore- and hind-limbs, but pollex and
  hallux exist in the skeleton, with a single phalanx each. There is only a
  single pair of mammae, and in correspondence with this but two or three
  young are produced at a time. The hind-feet have bristles very much like
  those of <i>Ctenodactylus</i>. The molars, however, are 4/4. There are
  twelve ribs, of which six reach the sternum. The latter is made up of six
  pieces, and the manubrium in its breadth anteriorly suggests that of the
  Vizcachas. The clavicles are present.<a name="NtA_348"

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Caviidae.</b>&mdash;This family, which includes the Cavies
  and the Capybara, is entirely South American and West Indian in
  distribution. It embraces animals of fair to large size, the Capybara
  <!-- Page 492 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page492"></a>{492}</span>(or Carpincho) being the greatest of
  existing Rodents. The ears are well developed. The toes are commonly
  reduced, and the members of this family possess only a rudimentary tail.
  The hair though rough is not spiny. Other characters had best be deferred
  until the several genera are treated of. We shall begin with the giant of
  the family, the genus <i>Hydrochoerus</i>. This genus contains but a
  single species, <i>H. capybara</i> of South America. It reaches a length
  of some 4 or 5 feet. The ears are not large; the tail is completely
  absent. The fore-feet are four-toed, the hind-feet three-toed; the digits
  are webbed, though not to a very great degree, and the nails have the
  appearance of hoofs. There are fourteen dorsal vertebrae; the clavicle is
  absent. In the skull the paroccipital processes are of great length. The
  infra-orbital foramen is large. The most remarkable fact about the teeth
  is the great size of the posterior molar of the upper jaw; it has
  fourteen folds of enamel, more than all the anterior teeth possess
  collectively. The incisors are white and grooved in front. The
  measurements of the alimentary tract as given by Tullberg are: small
  intestine, 4350 mm.; caecum, 450 mm.; large intestine, 1500 mm.</p>

  <p>The Capybara or Carpincho is largely aquatic in its habits. Their
  "favourite locality," writes Mr. Aplin,<a name="NtA_349"
  href="#Nt_349"><sup>[349]</sup></a> "is a broad laguna <!-- Page 493
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page493"></a>{493}</span>in the river,
  furnished with open water, and also beds of 'camelotes,'&mdash;a sloping
  open grassy bank on one side, where the Carpinchos can lie in the daytime
  in the cooler weather, sleeping and basking in the sunshine; on the other
  a low shelving bank, clothed with 'Sarandi' scrub growing out into the
  black reeking mud and shallow water beyond." They always take to the
  water when alarmed, at a rate and with a gait which reminded Mr. Aplin of
  a Pig. When in the water they swim slowly with the upper part of the
  head, including nose, eyes, and ears, above the surface. But they can
  dive for a considerable time and distance, and baffle their enemies by
  seeking the shelter of a mass of water-plants, and lying there with their
  noses only just above the surface.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Dolichotis</i><a name="NtA_350"
  href="#Nt_350"><sup>[350]</sup></a> has long ears, and generally
  resembles a rather long-legged Hare in appearance. The front-feet are
  four-toed, the hind three-toed. The Patagonian Cavy, as this animal is
  called, has twelve dorsal vertebrae, and rudimentary clavicles.<a
  name="NtA_351" href="#Nt_351"><sup>[351]</sup></a> The paroccipital
  processes are long; the incisors are white, and are not grooved in front.
  The sternum has six pieces, and seven ribs reach it.</p>

  <p><i>Cavia</i>, including the species <i>C. porcellus</i>, the
  Guinea-pig (which name is a corruption apparently of Guiana pig), has the
  same number of toes on its hind- and fore-feet as has the Capybara. The
  name applied to the wild stock whence our Guinea-pig is derived is the
  Restless Cavy. The fur is greyish; of the domestic animals the colour is
  too well known to need description.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Dasyproctidae.</b>&mdash;The genus <i>Coelogenys</i>
  includes but two species. <i>C. paca</i>, known as the "Spotted Cavy" or
  "Paca," has a brown body, with white spots like those of a Dasyure; it is
  one of the largest of Rodents, and has a quite short tail. The hand and
  foot are both provided with five digits; but the thumb is small, and in
  the foot the three middle toes considerably exceed the others in length.
  The hind-foot is practically three-toed. The fibula is not nearly so
  reduced as in <i>Dolichotis</i>. The skull of the animal is remarkable
  for the extraordinary development in breadth of the jugal arch, which is
  sculptured externally. There is a large cavity formed below, at the
  maxillary end of this huge <!-- Page 494 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page494"></a>{494}</span>arch, by the curving inwards of the bone,
  which lodges a cavity continuous with the mouth. The palate has
  anteriorly a ridge on either side, and is thus divided from the sides of
  the face in a way which is not found<a name="NtA_352"
  href="#Nt_352"><sup>[352]</sup></a> in the allies of <i>Coelogenys</i>.
  Clavicles are present. There are thirteen dorsal vertebrae. The incisors
  are coloured red in front. The animal is South American, and in that
  continent is limited to the Brazilian sub-region. This, the best-known
  species of Paca, is called the Gualilla by the natives of Ecuador; in the
  same district another form is met with which the natives term Sachacui
  (signifying Forest Cavy). It is very often the case that a different
  native name expresses a real specific difference; and to the latter form
  M. T. Stolzmann has given the name of <i>C. taczanowskii</i>.<a
  name="NtA_353" href="#Nt_353"><sup>[353]</sup></a> This form, unlike the
  common Paca, which is fond of forests and low-lying ground in the
  neighbourhood of water, is alpine in habitat, living upon mountains of
  6000 to 10,000 feet. It burrows in much the same way as its congener, and
  is greatly sought after as food, its meat possessing an "exquisite
  taste." It is pursued by dogs, by whose aid one of the two entrances to
  the burrow is guarded, and the creature is smoked out and killed with a
  stick.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Dasyprocta</i>, containing those Rodents known as
  Agoutis, is divisible into several species, apparently about twelve, all
  of which are, like the Pacas, confined to the Neotropical region. They
  have, however, a much wider range within that region, and occur as far
  north as in Central America and in some of the West Indian Islands. They
  are of rather smaller size than the Paca, and are without spots. The
  colour is of a golden brown in some forms, but usually has a freckled,
  grizzled, greenish kind of appearance. The tail is stumpy, the hind-limbs
  are distinctly longer than those of the Paca, and the two lateral toes
  have disappeared from the feet&mdash;a concomitant as it seems of the
  Agouti's greater powers of running. The three metatarsals are closely
  pressed together, and the foot is as it were on the way towards the
  highly-modified foot of the Jerboa. The fore-feet are, however,
  five-toed. The clavicle is rudimentary,<a name="NtA_354"
  href="#Nt_354"><sup>[354]</sup></a> whereas it is well developed in the
  Paca. The skull has not the peculiar modifications of that of the
  last-mentioned type. The sternum has seven <!-- Page 495 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page495"></a>{495}</span>pieces, and eight ribs
  reach it. A curious difference between this genus and the last is in the
  relative proportions of the regions of the intestine. The figures given
  by Tullberg for the two animals are&mdash;for <i>Coelogenys</i>, small
  intestine, 4800 mm.; caecum, 230 mm.; large intestine, 21,000
  mm.;&mdash;for <i>Dasyprocta aguti</i> the same author gives: small
  intestine, 4200 mm.; caecum, 200 mm.; large intestine, 1000 mm. The
  Agouti, says Mr. Rodway,<a name="NtA_355"
  href="#Nt_355"><sup>[355]</sup></a> is as wily as the Fox. "If chased he
  will run along the shallows of a creek to hide his scent from the dogs,
  or swim over and back again several times for the same purpose. He never
  runs straight when pursued, but doubles, often hiding until a dog has
  passed, and then making off in a different direction. Like the fox he has
  been hunted for a very long period, and, like Reynard, has grown wiser
  with every generation."</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 5. Dinomyidae.</b>&mdash;The genus <i>Dinomys</i> of Dr.
  Peters<a name="NtA_356" href="#Nt_356"><sup>[356]</sup></a> is a very
  little known and remarkable form from South America allied to the
  Capybara, the Chinchilla, and other South American Rodents. It is only
  known by a single example found wandering about a courtyard in a town of
  Peru. It is externally like, and of about the same size as the Paca, but
  has a hairy tail. The animal is four-toed and plantigrade; the ears are
  short, and the nostrils are <img src="images/s.png" class="middle" style="height:2ex;" alt="S"
  />-shaped. It is usually regarded as belonging <!-- Page 496 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page496"></a>{496}</span>to a separate family
  which will include but the one species, <i>D. branickii</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 6. Chinchillidae.</b>&mdash;This family, likewise South
  American, contains three genera,<a name="NtA_357"
  href="#Nt_357"><sup>[357]</sup></a> all of which agree in having long
  limbs, especially the hind-limbs, and a bushy and well-developed tail.
  The hair is exceedingly soft, hence the commercial value of
  "chinchilla."</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Chinchilla</i>, containing but a single species, <i>C.
  laniger</i>, is a small and squirrel-like creature, living at
  considerable heights in the Andes. The eyes, as it is a nocturnal
  creature, are naturally large; and so also are the ears. The fore-feet
  have five toes, the hind-feet only four; they are furnished with feeble
  nails. The innermost toe of the hind-foot has a flat and nail-like claw.
  There are thirteen dorsal vertebrae, and the long tail has more than
  twenty. The clavicle is well developed, as in the other genera of this
  family. The large intestine of this animal is extraordinarily long; the
  proportions of the different regions of the gut are shown by the
  following measurements: small intestine, 820 mm.; caecum, 125 mm.; large
  intestine, 1340 mm. Such a disproportion between the large intestine and
  the small, to the advantage of the former, is a very strange fact in the
  anatomy of this Rodent.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Lagidium</i> (also called <i>Lagotis</i>), which includes
  "Cuvier's Chinchilla," is also a mountain dweller. There are several
  species of this genus, which differs from <i>Chinchilla</i> by the
  complete abortion of the thumb and of the great toe. The intestinal
  proportions are those of <i>Chinchilla</i>. The ears and tail are long.
  <i>L. cuvieri</i> measures 1½ feet in length.</p>

  <p><i>Lagostomus</i>, again, has but one species, <i>L.
  trichodactylus</i>. The animal has a tail about half the length of the
  body. The digits are reduced as compared with <i>Chinchilla</i>, there
  being but four on the fore- and three on the hind-feet. There are only
  twelve dorsal vertebrae, and seven ribs reach the sternum. In the skull a
  distinguishing mark from the last two genera is the separation of the
  infra-orbital foramen into two by a thin lamella of bone. The large
  intestine is between one-half and one-third the length of the small
  intestine, and thus differs much from that of <i>Chinchilla</i>. <!--

  <p>The Vizcacha lives in societies of twenty to thirty members,<a
  name="NtA_358" href="#Nt_358"><sup>[358]</sup></a> in a "village"
  ("Vizcachera"), a dozen or so of burrows, which intercommunicate. They
  lie at home during the day and come out in the evening. Their burrows,
  like those of the Prairie Marmot, harbour other creatures, which
  apparently live on amicable terms with the Vizcachas; such are the
  burrowing owl, a small swallow, and a <i>Geositta</i>. The Fox also
  affects these burrows, but then he ejects the rightful owner of the
  particular burrow which he selects. When the young Foxes are born the
  vixen hunts the Vizcachas for food. The Vizcacha has a most varied voice,
  producing "guttural, sighing, shrill, and deep tones," and Mr. Hudson
  doubts if there is "any other four-footed beast so loquacious or with a
  dialect so extensive." These animals are very friendly, and pay visits
  from village to village; they will attempt to rescue their friends if
  attacked by a Weasel or a Peccary, and to disinter those covered up in
  their burrows by man.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 7. Cercolabidae.</b>&mdash;A number of the characters which
  differentiate this family from the Hystricidae or Ground Porcupines of
  the Old World are given under the description of the latter. The
  principal external characters are the prehensile tail, the admixture of
  spines with hairs, and the nature of the sole of the foot. In these
  points the New-World Cercolabidae differ from the Old-World Hystricidae.
  It is interesting to notice that <!-- Page 498 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page498"></a>{498}</span>in both families we
  have long-tailed and short-tailed forms. <i>Cercolabes</i> corresponds to
  <i>Atherura</i> or <i>Trichys</i>, and <i>Erethizon</i> to
  <i>Hystrix</i>.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Erethizon</i>, the "Urson" of Canada, has a short, stumpy
  tail. Its spines are almost hidden by enveloping hair. The fore-feet have
  four, the hind-feet five toes. The short tail of this creature is
  remarkable when we reflect upon its climbing habits. It appears, however,
  to be a weapon with which it strikes sideways at the enemy.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:41%;">
      <a href="images/244.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/244.jpg"

<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 244.&mdash;Brazilian Tree Porcupine. <i>Sphingurus prehensilis.</i> × <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">6</span>.</p>

  <p>Of the Neotropical genus <i>Cercolabes</i> (sometimes called
  <i>Sphingurus</i>, <i>Synetheres</i>, or <i>Coendou</i>) there are some
  eight or nine species, all found in Central and South America. The animal
  is arboreal, and has in correspondence with that habit a prehensile tail.
  The spines are not so stout as in the Ground Porcupines, and are often
  coloured yellowish or reddish. In correlation with its tree-frequenting
  habits the bones of <i>Cercolabes</i> show certain differences from those
  of the Ground Porcupines. The scapula is broader and rounder in front
  than is that of <i>Hystrix</i>; the phalanges of the thumb (which is
  rudimentary) are fused together as in the Canadian <i>Erethizon</i>; but
  those of the very small hallux are also fused, whereas in
  <i>Erethizon</i>, as in <i>Hystrix</i>, they are separate. In one
  species, <i>C. insidiosus</i>, Sir W. Flower states that there are as
  many as seventeen dorsal vertebrae and thirty-six caudals. The tail is
  thus very long. In <i>C. villosus</i> there are fifteen dorsals and
  twenty-seven caudals; eight ribs reach the sternum, which is composed of
  seven pieces, the <!-- Page 499 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page499"></a>{499}</span>sixth being very small. The clavicles are
  well developed. A curious fact about <i>C. villosus</i> is that the
  acetabular cavity is perforate (on both sides), or at least only closed
  by membrane. In many forms of Rodents the bone is very thin in this
  region. This fact perhaps lessens the significance of the perforation of
  the acetabulum of <i>Echidna</i> (see p. <a href="#page109">109</a>).</p>

  <p>Of the allied genus <i>Chaetomys</i>, also Neotropical, there is but a
  single species, which inhabits Brazil. It has a nearly completely closed
  orbit, a feature which differentiates it from the last animal, and one
  which also shows it to be a more modified form. The spiny covering is
  less pronounced than in its allies.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 8. Hystricidae.</b>&mdash;This family is characterised by the
  fact that all its members possess spines; but the tail, if at all long,
  is not prehensile, and the soles of the feet are smooth and not covered
  with rough tubercles, as in the Tree Porcupines of the next family,
  Erethizontidae. The clavicle is less developed than in the arboreal
  forms. In the organs of digestion there are points of a family difference
  between the two groups of spiny Rodents. The tongue has serrated scales
  arranged in transverse rows, which are directed backwards. A
  gall-bladder, though not always present, is sometimes found; it
  apparently never exists in the arboreal Porcupines and in
  <i>Erethizon</i>. The lungs show a great tendency to subdivision, which
  appears to be especially marked in the genus <i>Atherura</i>. The caecum
  seems also to be shorter in the Ground Porcupines. In <i>Hystrix
  cristata</i> the small intestine measures 15 feet 7 inches; the caecum, 8
  inches; the large intestine, 4 feet 4 inches<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span>in <i>Atherura africana</i> the caecum measures
  7½ inches; the large intestine, 1 foot 10 inches. The corresponding
  measurements of <i>Synetheres villosus</i> were: small intestine, 7 feet
  3 inches; caecum, 1 foot 4 inches; large intestine, 2 feet 7 inches. In
  <i>Erethizon</i> the caecum is 2 feet 4 inches in length. These
  differences are too large and too constant in a number of presumedly
  allied forms to be overlooked.</p>

  <p>Mr. Parsons has directed attention<a name="NtA_359"
  href="#Nt_359"><sup>[359]</sup></a> also to a number of muscular
  differences, such indeed as might be expected to occur between animals of
  such different habits.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Hystrix</i> embraces the better-known Porcupines. It is a
  genus of wide range, extending from the East Indies to Africa, <!-- Page
  500 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page500"></a>{500}</span>and even
  occurring in Europe. There are several species, of which the common
  <i>Hystrix cristata</i> is the best known, and is the one which is to be
  found in Europe.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:40%;">
      <a href="images/245.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/245.jpg"

  </div>
<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 245.&mdash;Common Porcupine. <i>Hystrix cristata.</i> × <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">10</span>.</p>

  <p>The spines of the common form and of the others are solid in the
  middle of the body, but on the tail they are expanded into hollow quills,
  which make much rattling. They are as a rule black and white, the middle
  of the spine being banded with black. A great crest of coarse long hairs
  on the head is responsible for the scientific name of the well-known
  form. Sometimes in this genus, as in the Tree Porcupines of Brazil, the
  spines are orange or yellow; but it is said that the colour is soon lost
  in this country. As a matter of fact it is the easiest thing in the world
  to wash out with ordinary tap-water much of the yellow colour of the
  spines of the South American <i>Sphingurus</i>. The same may be the case
  with the pigment of the Old-World Porcupines. There are fourteen to
  fifteen dorsal vertebrae and four or five lumbars. The tail varies in
  length, but is shorter than the long tail of the arboreal New-World
  forms. It seems impossible when mentioning the Porcupine to escape from
  some observations about its alleged habit of shooting its quills. For
  some reason or other Buffon has got the credit of inventing, or at <!--
  Page 501 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page501"></a>{501}</span>least
  promulgating, this legend, which has even grown so in the telling that
  the quills are said to be capable of penetrating planks of wood. What
  Buffon said <i>apropos</i> of this matter is, "The marvellous commonly is
  pleasingly believed, and increases in proportion to the number of hands
  it passes through." It is of course the rattling of the spines and the
  occasional falling out of loose ones which has started the legend. They
  are, however, excellent weapons of offence, and the animal charges
  somewhat backwards to make the best use of them against the foe. The
  spines, however, are by no means an absolute protection, since, as Mr.
  Ridley informs us,<a name="NtA_360" href="#Nt_360"><sup>[360]</sup></a>
  Tigers will kill and eat these animals just as the Thylacine is
  apparently indifferent to the spiny armature of <i>Echidna</i>.</p>

  <p>Of the Brush-tail Porcupine, <i>Atherura</i><a name="NtA_361"
  href="#Nt_361"><sup>[361]</sup></a> there are at any rate two species,
  the West African <i>A. africana</i> and the Malayan <i>A.
  fasciculata</i>. It is interesting that the gap in the present
  distribution is partially filled by the discovery of fossil teeth near
  Madras. The genus does not differ widely in external appearance from
  <i>Hystrix</i>; it has, however, a rather longer tail; there are fewer
  large spines, and there is a tuft of them at the end of the tail, whence
  is derived the name of the genus. The frontal bones project a little
  distance between the nasals, a feature which does not seem to appear in
  the true Porcupines. There are fourteen dorsal vertebrae and five
  lumbars. The twenty-four caudal vertebrae of this Porcupine shows how
  much longer is its tail than that of <i>Hystrix</i>; for in the latter
  twelve is about the number.</p>

  <p>A third genus of Old-World Porcupine is the singular <i>Trichys</i>.<a
  name="NtA_362" href="#Nt_362"><sup>[362]</sup></a> Of this there is but
  one species, <i>T. lipura</i>. It is a curious fact that out of three
  examples, all from Borneo, two were quite without a tail. But this
  appears to be merely a mutilation, though it is singular that the natives
  state it to be without a tail. One cannot help thinking of the way in
  which lizards sometimes shed their tails when pecked at. The tail of this
  genus is more than half the length of the body and head. <i>Trichys</i>
  has sixteen dorsal and six lumbar vertebrae. There is a tuft of quills at
  the end of the tail, which are thin and compressed, <!-- Page 502
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page502"></a>{502}</span>though
  truncate at the free extremity and hollow; they represent in a more
  rudimentary way the much stronger tuft at the end of the tail of other
  Porcupines. It is a curious fact that this and other Porcupines possess a
  mechanism for warning their foes precisely comparable to that of the
  rattlesnake. There are sixteen dorsal vertebrae.</p>

<h5><span class="sc">Sub-Order 2.</span> DUPLICIDENTATA.</h5>

  <p>The chief feature of this group is the existence of two pairs of
  incisor teeth in the upper jaw, of which the inner are very small and lie
  behind the outer. In the skull the infra-orbital foramen is small; the
  incisive foramina are very large. The tail is short or absent.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Leporidae.</b>&mdash;This family is distinguished from the
  Lagomyidae by the long ears, by the tail, which is present, though short,
  and by the longer limbs. There are six teeth belonging to the molar
  series in the upper jaw, and five of the same in the lower. The clavicle
  is imperfect.</p>

  <p>The longest known genus of this family, <i>Lepus</i>, was, until the
  quite recent discovery of <i>Romerolagus</i>, the only genus. It is of
  universal range, excepting Australasia and Madagascar, and consists of
  about sixty species. These are the Hares and Rabbits, to the former being
  assigned the longer-limbed forms.</p>

  <p>As every text-book of zoology contains a more or less elaborate
  account of the structure of the Common Rabbit, and as there is but little
  structural difference between the members of the genus, a short account
  of the generic peculiarities of <i>Lepus</i> will suffice here. The
  fore-feet are five-toed, the hind-limbs four-toed. The hairy integument
  enters the mouth cavity, and the inside of the cheeks have a hairy
  covering. The soles of the feet are, moreover, hairy. The maxillary bones
  are curiously sculptured.<a name="page503"></a></p>

  in the comparatively shorter ears and legs. The ears have not, to so

  excavation. A difference in the structure of the caecum, which
  distinguishes the Rabbit from the Hare, has been <!-- Page 504 --><span

  Professor W. N. Parker.<a name="NtA_363"
  href="#Nt_363"><sup>[363]</sup></a> These differences have led some to
  approve of its separation from the Hares into a genus <i>Oryctolagus</i>.
  This animal is believed to be an introduced species, and to have been
  brought by man into these islands. Its original home is the Spanish
  Peninsula, the south of France, Algiers, and some of the Mediterranean
  islands. Mr. Lydekker thinks that the only other species of <i>Lepus</i>
  which can be considered to be a "Rabbit" is the Asiatic <i>L.
  hispidus</i>.</p>

  <p>Of Hares there are two species in this country. The Common Hare, <i>L.
  europaeus</i> (the name <i>L. timidus</i> seems to be really applicable
  to another species to be referred to presently), extends all over Europe
  excepting the extreme north of Russia and Scandinavia. It is not known in
  Ireland, and, curiously enough, attempts to acclimatise this animal in
  that island have failed&mdash;a state of affairs which contrasts with the
  fatal ease with which the Rabbit has been introduced into Australia.
  Ireland has, however, the Variable Hare, <i>L. timidus</i> (also called
  <i>L. variabilis</i>), a species which is common in other parts of
  Europe, and which extends as far east as Japan. This species differs from
  its ally by the fact that it often turns white in winter with the
  exception of the black tips to the ears. In Ireland this change does not
  always occur; but Mr. Barrett-Hamilton has commented upon the fact that
  Hares of this species do change on Irish mountains. It appears that in
  this animal the change from the winter to the summer dress is
  accomplished by the actual casting off of the white hairs and their
  replacement by a fresh growth of "blue" hairs. A similar change occurs in
  the American <i>L. americanus</i>.</p>

  <p>Dr. Forsyth Major has noted the fact that the various species of Hares
  can be distinguished by the condition of the furrows upon the upper
  incisors. Thus two African species, <i>L. crawshayi</i> and <i>L.
  whytei</i>, are to be separated by the fact that in the former the
  incisors are quite flat, whereas in <i>L. whytei</i> the groove is more
  prominent and there is a second shallow furrow.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Romerolagus</i><a name="NtA_364"
  href="#Nt_364"><sup>[364]</sup></a> is quite a recent discovery. It
  occurs on the slopes of Popocatepetl in Mexico; it has the general aspect
  of the last genus, and is spoken of as a "Rabbit." It inhabits runs in
  the long grass which clothes the sides of the <!-- Page 505 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page505"></a>{505}</span>mountain. Externally it
  is something like the Pikas, since it has no tail visible. The ears, too,
  are short, and the hind-legs comparatively short. The skull is very like
  that of the Rabbit; but in other osteological details it is aberrant.
  Thus the clavicle is quite complete, and only six ribs articulate with
  the sternum, instead of the seven that we find in the Rabbit.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Lagomyidae.</b>&mdash;The animals of this family are
  smaller than the Hares and Rabbits; they have short Vole-like ears and no
  external tail. The limbs also appear to be shorter. As there is but a
  single genus, the characters of the family may be described in connexion
  with those of the genus, which is known as <i>Lagomys</i> (apparently
  more correctly <i>Ochotona</i>). Of this genus there are about sixteen
  species, which are mainly Asiatic; one species extends its range into
  Eastern Europe, and three are North American.</p>

  <p>The skull has not the supra-orbital grooves of the Rabbits, and has a
  well-marked backward process of the zygomatic arch. There are eighteen
  dorsal vertebrae. The molars and premolars are five.</p>

  <p>The vernacular names of "Pika" and "Piping Hares" have been applied to
  the members of this genus, the latter on account of their peculiar call.
  They live among rocks in companies and they burrow. They are usually
  found at considerable altitudes: thus <i>L. roylei</i>, the "Himalayan
  Mouse Hare," is found at elevations as high as 16,000 feet; while <i>L.
  ladacensis</i> gets even higher, 19,000 feet having been recorded. With
  the habits of a Marmot, so far as concerns living in burrows and at great
  altitudes, the animals of this genus, with their squat form and short
  ears, are not unlike those animals. In the past this genus occurred more
  generally over Europe. Species from Miocene beds have been met with in
  England, France, Germany, and Italy.</p>

  <p><b>Fossil Rodents.</b>&mdash;Quite a large number of existing genera
  of Rodents are known from even the earlier strata of the Tertiary period.
  The Squirrels (and even the genus <i>Sciurus</i> itself) occur in the
  Upper Eocene. So, too, do the genera <i>Myoxus</i>, and (in South
  America) <i>Lagostomus</i>. <i>Spermophilus</i>, <i>Acomys</i>,
  <i>Hystrix</i>, <i>Lagomys</i>, <i>Lepus</i>, <i>Hesperomys</i> are known
  from Miocene rocks. <i>Rhizomys</i>, <i>Castor</i>, <i>Cricetus</i>,
  <i>Mus</i>, <i>Microtus</i>, and some others appear to have originated so
  far as we know in the Pliocene, while a still larger series of existing
  genera are Pleistocene. It is interesting <!-- Page 506 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page506"></a>{506}</span>to note that some of
  the extinct genera were much larger than recent forms. At present,
  <i>Hydrochoerus</i> is the biggest Rodent; but the genus <i>Megamys</i>
  from the Pampas formation of Argentina was "nearly as large as an ox."
  The wider range of genera in the past is illustrated by <i>Hystrix</i>,
  which, now an Old-World form, is represented by remains in the Miocene
  and Pliocene of America.</p>

  <p>It is a significant fact that of living genera <i>Sciurus</i> is the
  oldest; for it has been pointed out that in a number of features the
  Squirrels are among the most primitive of Rodents. The zygomatic arch is
  slender, and has thus not acquired the specialisation that is to be found
  in that part of the skull in other Rodents; moreover, the "jugal bone is
  not supported by any process from the maxilla exactly as in the primitive
  Ungulata." The feet, too, are unspecialised, though that is the case with
  many other genera. It may also be pointed out that the teeth bear not a
  little likeness to those of <i>Ornithorhynchus</i> in their
  multituberculate character.</p>

  <p>Some few fossil forms have already been dealt with in the preceding
  pages.</p>

  <p>The two genera <i>Castoroides</i> and <i>Amblyrhiza</i>, from the
  Pleistocene of North America and the West Indies, are usually regarded as
  forming a family. The skull of the former genus indicates an animal of
  the size of a Bear. It is compared to that of <i>Castor</i>, but it has a
  wide infra-orbital foramen. The teeth are four in each jaw, and are
  formed of three to five lamellae; the incisors of this animal are
  powerful but short. <i>Amblyrhiza</i>, on the other hand, has long
  incisors which are longitudinally grooved anteriorly. It has a free
  fibula. This latter as well as other characters have led Tullberg to
  remove it from association with <i>Castoroides</i>.</p>

<h5><b>Order X. TILLODONTIA.</b></h5>

  <p>This group of Eocene mammals is to be defined by a number of
  characters, of which the more important are the following<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span>The incisors are enlarged, grow from persistent
  pulps, and are coated with enamel upon the outer surface only; they are
  those of the second pair only, the first and third having disappeared or
  become small. The canines are reduced in the later forms. <!-- Page 507
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page507"></a>{507}</span></p>

  </div>
<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 247.&mdash;<i>Tillotherium fodiens.</i> Left lateral view of skull. (From Flower,
after Marsh.)</p>

  <p>These animals have been regarded as ancestral Rodents, to which the
  tooth characters just mentioned clearly show likenesses. The earliest
  known form is <i>Esthonyx</i>. This genus shows such primitive
  characters, compared with its later representatives, as the existence of
  all three pairs of incisors in the upper jaw, but only two in the lower
  jaw. The enlarged incisors of both jaws do not seem to have grown from
  persistent pulps.</p>

  <p><i>Anchippodus</i>, a later form, still preserves the upper pair of
  first incisors in a vestigial form; the strong second incisors grew from
  persistent pulps. The most recent genus, <i>Tillotherium</i>, shows the
  characteristics of the group at their height. The strong Rodent-like,
  chisel-shaped incisors, which are reinforced by a small additional pair
  in the upper jaws only, are persistent. The grinding teeth are of the
  tritubercular pattern; there are three of each kind in the upper jaw, but
  in the lower jaw only two premolars on each side. This is at any rate the
  case with some, while others have three. The canine, though present in
  both jaws, is insignificant. As in many ancient types, there is an
  entepicondylar foramen in the humerus. The feet were five-toed, and bore
  sharp, laterally-compressed claws. The skull has been compared in general
  aspect to that of a Bear.</p>

<h6>INSECTIVORA&mdash;CHIROPTERA</h6>

<h5><b>Order XI. INSECTIVORA.</b></h5>

  <p>The Insectivora<a name="NtA_365" href="#Nt_365"><sup>[365]</sup></a>
  are an order of mammals to which it is (to quote Professor Huxley)
  "exceedingly difficult to give a definition." They are, however, none of
  them large animals, and most of them are nocturnal in habit&mdash;two
  circumstances which may have had something to do with their survival from
  past ages, as may have also their modification to so many and diverse
  modes of life; for everything points to the antiquity of the group. They
  are, for instance, more or less plantigrade. The snout is generally long,
  and is often prolonged into a short proboscis.<a name="NtA_366"
  href="#Nt_366"><sup>[366]</sup></a> There is a tendency for the teeth to
  be of a generalised type, and their number is often the typical mammalian
  forty-four. Moreover, trituberculate teeth, which are certainly an
  ancient form of tooth, are common; and indeed the Insectivora of the
  southern regions of the globe, <i>e.g.</i> Centetidae, Solenodontidae,
  and Chrysochloridae, have the most prevalent trituberculism, a fact which
  is of importance in considering the age of the animal life of these
  regions of the world. The limbs are, as a rule, provided with five
  digits. The hemispheres of the brain are usually smooth, and do not
  extend over the cerebellum. The palate is often fenestrate as in the
  Marsupials, and as in that group the lower jaw is sometimes inflected.
  But the latter character also occurs in the Sea-lions and elsewhere.
  Clavicles are present, as a rule, but not in <i>Potamogale</i>. <!-- Page
  509 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page509"></a>{509}</span></p>

  <p>There is, furthermore, a distinct tendency towards a disappearance of
  functional milk teeth, which is best seen in <i>Sorex</i>, where there
  are only seven milk teeth, none of which ever cut the gum. This
  suppression of the milk dentition is like that of the Marsupials,
  Edentates, and Whales, all of which appear to be&mdash;the first
  certainly are&mdash;ancient forms of mammalian life.</p>

  <p>There is also a fairly well-defined, though shallow, cloaca in many
  genera. Finally, the testes are purely abdominal in some, and in none is
  there a full descent into a scrotum, as in the more highly-developed
  Eutheria.</p>

<h5><span class="sc">Sub-Order 1.</span> INSECTIVORA VERA.</h5>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Erinaceidae.</b>&mdash;This family contains the genera
  <i>Erinaceus</i>, <i>Hylomys</i>, and <i>Gymnura</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Hylomys</i>, considered by Dobson to fall within <i>Gymnura</i>, is
  kept separate by Leche.<a name="NtA_367"
  href="#Nt_367"><sup>[367]</sup></a> <i>H. suillus</i> is a Malayan
  animal, small in size, about 5 inches long, with a short tail. Like
  <i>Gymnura</i> it is spineless. The ears are decidedly large and nude.
  There is one pair of inguinal and one pair of thoracic teats. The colour
  above is a rusty brown with yellowish-white under parts. The palms and
  soles are quite naked. In its general form it recalls <i>Tupaia</i> very
  much more than its own immediate relatives. There is no doubt, however,
  of its systematic position when the skeleton and teeth are examined. A
  variety has been described from altitudes of 3000 to 8000 feet on Mount
  Kina Balu in Borneo. It has the complete dentition of forty-four teeth.
  There are fourteen pairs of ribs. As in <i>Gymnura</i> the tibia and
  fibula are united below. The genus is considered by Leche to be the
  oldest existing type of Erinaceidae.</p>

  <p><i>Gymnura</i><a name="NtA_368" href="#Nt_368"><sup>[368]</sup></a> is
  also a Malayan form with the complete dentition of the last, but with
  fifteen pairs of ribs and a longer tail, consisting of twenty-three
  vertebrae as against fourteen. There is, as with <i>Hylomys</i>, but one
  species, <i>G. rafflesii</i>. This animal has a peculiar odour,
  resembling decomposed cooked vegetables. <!-- Page 510 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page510"></a>{510}</span>The under surface of
  the tail is rough, and it is thought by Dr. Blanford that it may be of
  use to the animal in climbing. Its compressed terminal third and the
  fringe of stiff bristles on the under surface of this indicate, according
  to Dr. Dobson, powers of swimming, or at any rate a not very remote
  ancestry of swimming creatures. It is purely insectivorous in diet.</p>

  <p><i>Erinaceus</i>, including the Hedgehogs, is a widely distributed
  genus&mdash;Palaearctic, Oriental, and Ethiopian in range. There are
  about twenty species. The familiar spines distinguish the Hedgehogs from
  their allies, as also the fact that they possess but thirty-six teeth,
  the formula being I&nbsp;3/2 C&nbsp;1/1 Pm&nbsp;3/2 M&nbsp;3/3. There are fifteen or fourteen
  ribs, and the tail is very short, consisting of only twelve vertebrae. As
  in <i>Gymnura</i> there is no caecum. The upper canine has usually, as in
  other Erinaceidae, two roots, but not in <i>E. europaeus</i>, which is
  one of the most modified of Hedgehogs.</p>

  <p>The Hedgehog is a more omnivorous creature than <i>Gymnura</i>. It
  eats not only insects and slugs, but also chickens and young game birds,
  and lastly vipers. Four, or in some cases as many as five or six, young
  are produced at a birth; they are blind, with soft and flexible white
  spines. In hot and dry weather Hedgehogs disappear; they come forth in
  rainy weather. The English Hedgehog, as is well known, hibernates. The
  Indian species do not. The Hedgehog is occasionally spineless, which
  condition may be regarded as an atavistic reversion.<a name="NtA_369"
  href="#Nt_369"><sup>[369]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The Hedgehog has acquired the reputation of carrying off apples
  transfixed upon its spines. Blumenbach thus quaintly describes this and
  other habits of the animal, whose English name he gives as "hedgidog":
  "Il se nourrit des productions des deux règnes organisés, miaule comme un
  chat, et peut avaler une quantité énorme de mouches cantharides. Il est
  certain qu'il pique les fruits avec les épines de son dos, et les porte
  ainsi dans son terrier."<a name="NtA_370"
  href="#Nt_370"><sup>[370]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The Miocene <i>Palaeoerinaceus</i> is so little different from
  <i>Erinaceus</i> that it is really hardly generically separable.
  <i>Erinaceus</i> is therefore clearly one of the oldest living genera of
  mammals.</p>

  <p><i>Necrogymnura</i> of the same epoch and the same beds (Quercy
  Phosphorites) is doubtless an ancestral form. The palate is <!-- Page 511
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page511"></a>{511}</span>perforated as
  in <i>Erinaceus</i> (it is not so in <i>Gymnura</i> and <i>Hylomys</i>),
  but on the whole it comes nearest to <i>Hylomys</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Tupaiidae.</b>&mdash;This family contains the genera
  <i>Tupaia</i> and <i>Ptilocercus</i>. <i>Tupaia</i> is Oriental in range,
  extending as far east as Borneo. There are a dozen or so of species,
  which are generally arboreal and have the outward aspect of Squirrels. It
  has been suggested that this is a case of mimicry, the animal gaining
  some advantage by its likeness to the Rodent. The name Tupaia, it should
  be added, means Squirrel, and the long-nosed Squirrel, <i>Sciurus
  laticaudatus</i>, is so extraordinarily like it that "one has to look at
  the teeth" to distinguish them. Moreover this Squirrel, like some
  Tupaias, lives largely on the ground among fallen logs. <i>Tupaia</i>
  resembles a Lemur in the complete orbit. The dental formula is I&nbsp;2/3
  C&nbsp;1/1 Pm&nbsp;3/3 M&nbsp;3/3 = 38. The sublingua, too, is stated by Garrod to be
  like that of <i>Chiromys</i>. There is a minute caecum in <i>T.
  belangeri</i>, none in <i>T. tana</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Ptilocercus</i><a name="NtA_371"
  href="#Nt_371"><sup>[371]</sup></a> has a pen-like posterior portion to
  the tail, a modification which is found in other groups of animals. The
  tail of certain Phalangers, for instance, shows this same modification.
  The rest of the tail is scaly. The animal, as was pointed out by Dr.
  Gray,<a name="NtA_372" href="#Nt_372"><sup>[372]</sup></a> looks very
  much like a Phalanger. The orbit is entire as in <i>Tupaia</i>. The
  fingers and toes are five. The one species, called after Sir Hugh Low,
  G.C.M.G., <i>P. lowi</i>, is a Bornean animal.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Centetidae.</b>&mdash;This family is entirely confined to
  the Island of Madagascar. It includes some seven genera. The best-known
  genus is <i>Centetes</i>. <i>C. ecaudatus</i>, the Tanrec, Tenrec, or
  Tendrac, is an animal a foot or so in length, without a tail, and with
  forty-four teeth.<a name="NtA_373" href="#Nt_373"><sup>[373]</sup></a>
  The immature animal is so different from the parent as to appear quite a
  different form. It has three narrow rows of spines along the back, which
  do not wholly disappear until the permanent dentition has been acquired.
  Even then the hairs are of a rather spiny character, particularly those
  upon the back of the head, which are erected when the animal is <!-- Page
  512 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page512"></a>{512}</span>annoyed.
  The Tanrec feeds mainly upon earthworms. It is "probably the most
  prolific of all animals," since as many as twenty-one young are said to
  have been brought forth at a birth. Some Opossums, however, have
  twenty-five teats.</p>

  <p><i>Hemicentetes</i><a name="NtA_374"
  href="#Nt_374"><sup>[374]</sup></a> is a genus with two species. These
  have spines mixed with the fur of the back. There is no caecum in this or
  in other Centetidae. The teeth are forty in number, there being only
  three molars.</p>

  <p><i>Ericulus setosus</i> is a small Insectivore, resembling externally
  a small Hedgehog. It is covered with close-set spines which, unlike what
  is found in <i>Erinaceus</i>, extend over the short tail. The total
  number of teeth is thirty-six, the formula being I&nbsp;2/2 C&nbsp;1/1 Pm&nbsp;3/3
  M&nbsp;3/3.</p>

  <p><i>Echinops</i><a name="NtA_375" href="#Nt_375"><sup>[375]</sup></a>
  is another spiny genus which is a stage in advance of <i>Ericulus</i>,
  for still another molar has been lost, reducing the total number of teeth
  to thirty-two. The dental formula is thus I&nbsp;2/2 C&nbsp;1/1 Pm&nbsp;3/3 M&nbsp;2/2. The
  zygomata are reduced to mere threads.</p>

  <p><i>Microgale</i>, a genus recently instituted by Mr. Thomas, is a
  small furry Insectivore with a long tail, which is more than double the
  length of the head and body. There are no less than forty-seven vertebrae
  in the tail, which is relatively longer than that of any other
  mammal.</p>

  <p><i>Limnogale</i>, discovered by Forsyth Major, is an aquatic genus,
  also furry and not spiny, which has departed from the Centetid type and
  taken to an aquatic life. The single species, <!-- Page 513 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page513"></a>{513}</span><i>L. mergulus</i>, is
  about the size of <i>Mus rattus</i>; it has webbed toes and a powerful
  laterally-compressed tail. Clavicles are present, which is not the case
  with <i>Potamogale</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Oryzoryctes</i> is a Mole-like Centetid. It has fossorial
  fore-limbs, but a fairly long tail. This genus is furry like the last
  two. It is said to burrow in the rice-fields and to do much harm. The
  teeth are forty in number, three incisors and three molars in each half
  of each jaw.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Potamogalidae.</b>&mdash;This family contains two genera,
  <i>Potamogale</i> and <i>Geogale</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Potamogale velox</i> is a West African animal, which though an
  Insectivore has the habits of an Otter. It is "somewhat larger than a
  stoat." The upper surface of the body is dark brown, the belly brownish
  yellow. It has a flat head and a long tail like the Stoat, but the tail
  is laterally compressed and very thick. The eyes are very small; the
  nostril has valves. The toes are not webbed; but the second and third
  toes are united for the whole length of their first phalanges. Along the
  outer side of the foot is a thin extension of the integument. In swimming
  the feet are drawn up along the body, hence webbing would be of no use;
  but the thin flattening prevents the edge of the foot from acting as a
  hindrance to the motion of the animal. M. du Chaillu describes it as
  catching fish, which it pursues with extreme rapidity in the clear
  mountain streams it frequents; but Dr. Dobson, remarking that no stomachs
  have been examined, thinks that water insects are more probably its prey.
  It is not known whether the animal possesses a caecum. The tooth
  formula<a name="NtA_376" href="#Nt_376"><sup>[376]</sup></a> is I&nbsp;3/3
  C&nbsp;1/1 Pm&nbsp;3/3 M&nbsp;3/3. The animal is exceptional among the Insectivora in
  having no clavicles.<a name="NtA_377" href="#Nt_377"><sup>[377]</sup></a>
  There are sixteen ribs; there is no zygomatic arch, and the pterygoids
  converge posteriorly.</p>

  <p><i>Geogale</i>, with one species, <i>G. aurita</i>, is a small
  representative of this family from Madagascar. It has only thirty-four
  teeth. When better known it may be necessary, thinks Mr. Lydekker, to
  make this animal the type of a separate family. The tibia and fibula are
  distinct, not confluent with one another as in <i>Potamogale</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 5. Solenodontidae.</b>&mdash;This family contains but a single
  genus. <!-- Page 514 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page514"></a>{514}</span></p>

  <p><i>Solenodon.</i> This genus, including two species, one from Cuba,
  the other from Hayti, was at one time referred to the Centetidae. It
  offers, however, numerous points of difference from the members of that
  family with some general points of agreement. Possibly its isolation in
  the two West Indian islands mentioned is comparable to the isolation of
  the Centetidae in Madagascar; they are both survivors of an ancient group
  of Insectivores extinct elsewhere. <i>Solenodon</i> has nearly the
  complete dentition. It has lost only one premolar, and has therefore
  forty teeth in all. The formula is thus I&nbsp;3/3 C&nbsp;1/1 Pm&nbsp;3/3 M&nbsp;3/3. It also
  differs from the Centetidae in having only two inguinal mammae instead of
  both inguinal and thoracic; the penis of the male does not project from a
  cloaca, but lies forward. On the other hand, the molars have their cusps
  arranged in the <img src="images/v.png" class="middle" style="height:2ex;" alt="V"
  />-fashion of the Centetidae, a fact, however, which, in the opinion of
  some, merely points to an ancient trituberculism not indicative of
  special affinity. It has, moreover, no zygoma in the skull, and there is
  no caecum. Dr. Dobson has furthermore tabulated a number of differences
  in muscular anatomy between the two families. <i>Solenodon</i> has a long
  naked tail. The snout, always developed in Insectivores, is
  extraordinarily long in this genus. It is a furry, not a spiny animal.
  <i>S. cubanus</i> is liable to fits of rage when irritated, a feature
  which it has in common with Shrews and Moles; it is also stated to have
  the ostrich-like way of concealing its head in a crevice, "apparently
  thinking itself then secure." But nothing is known of the genus in a wild
  state.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 6. Chrysochloridae.</b>&mdash;This family contains only the
  genus <i>Chrysochloris</i>, comprising some five species, all natives of
  Africa south of the equator. The scientific name of the genus, and also
  the vernacular name Cape Golden Mole, are derived from the beautiful
  iridescent hairs which are intermingled with softer and non-iridescent
  fur. <i>Chrysochloris</i> has <img src="images/v.png" class="middle" style="height:2ex;" alt="V"
  />-shaped cusped teeth like those that are possessed by the Centetidae
  and Solenodontidae. In the skull as in the Macroscelidae, etc., but not
  in the Centetidae, there are complete zygomata. They are Moles in habit,
  and the eyes are covered with skin; the ears, moreover, have no conches.
  The teeth are forty or thirty-six in number, the reduction being caused
  by the losing of a molar in those forms which possess the smaller
  number.<a name="NtA_378" href="#Nt_378"><sup>[378]</sup></a> It is
  interesting to notice that the <!-- Page 515 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page515"></a>{515}</span>adaptation to a digging life is brought
  about in quite a different way from that of the true Moles
  (<i>Talpa</i>). In the latter the fore-limbs are changed in position by
  the elongation of the manubrium sterni, carrying with it the clavicles,
  which are extraordinarily shortened (Fig. 251). In <i>Chrysochloris</i>,
  on the other hand, the same need (<i>i.e.</i> that the limbs project as
  little as possible from the sides of the body, while the length of the
  limbs is retained, and the leverage of the muscles unaffected) is
  provided for by a hollowing out of the walls of the thorax, the ribs and
  the sternum being here convex inwards. The sternum and the clavicles are
  not modified. The tibia and fibula are ankylosed below. In the manus,
  moreover, there are but four digits, of which the two middle ones are
  greatly enlarged. In the Moles there are five fingers, and all are
  enlarged; there is, too, a great radial sesamoid bone, which is as good
  as a sixth finger (which, indeed, it is considered to be, in common with
  similar structures in other animals, by some anatomists). The foot has
  only four toes.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 8. Talpidae.</b>&mdash;This family is confined to the
  Palaearctic and Nearctic regions, or practically so, being fairly equally
  <!-- Page 517 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page517"></a>{517}</span>distributed as regards genera; a Mole just
  gets over the boundary into the Oriental region. The genus <i>Talpa</i>
  is entirely Old World in range, and includes several species, of which
  the Common Mole, <i>T. europaea</i>, is the best known. There are forty
  teeth, one of the molars of the full mammalian dentition not being
  represented. In the milk dentition there is an additional premolar, not
  represented by a successor in the permanent dentition. The formula is
  thus I&nbsp;3/3 C&nbsp;1/1 Pm&nbsp;4/4 M&nbsp;3/3. There are no external ears, and the eyes
  are rudimentary; the soft silky fur is familiar to everybody. The sternum
  has a strong crest, associated with a powerful development of the
  pectoral muscles, so necessary to a burrowing animal. The animal, it is
  hardly necessary to state, lives underground in burrows excavated by
  itself, which have not, it has been stated, the elaborate and, it
  appears, fanciful shape assigned to them by many writers. At times Moles
  appear above ground. <!-- Page 518 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page518"></a>{518}</span>Their principal food consists of
  earthworms, and it may not be out of place to quote Topsell's quaint
  account of their pursuit of the annelids: "When the wormes are followed
  by molds (for by digging and heaving they foreknow their owne perdition)
  they fly to the superficies and very toppe of the earth, the silly beast
  knowing that the molde, their adversary, dare not followe them into the
  light, so that their wit in flying their enemy is greater than in turning
  againe when they are troade upon." It has lately been said<a
  name="NtA_381" href="#Nt_381"><sup>[381]</sup></a> that Moles store up
  earthworms for consumption during the winter, biting off their heads to
  prevent their crawling away.</p>

  <p><i>Scalops</i>, an American genus, is a Mole-like creature of largely
  aquatic habits, as its webbed hind-feet show; it has a short, naked tail.
  Apparently, like the Shrews, it has no lower canines.</p>

  <p><i>Condylura</i>, another American genus, is called the Star-nosed
  Mole on account of a curious radiating structure at the end of the
  snout.</p>

  <p><i>Myogale</i>, the Desman, is still more aquatic in habit, and
  connects the Moles with the Shrews, though, as in many of the former, it
  has lower canines. It has webbed hind-feet and a long tail. One species
  occurs in the Pyrenees, the other in Russia. A few other genera
  (<i>Urotrichus</i>, <i>Uropsilus</i>, <i>Scaptonyx</i>, <i>Dymecodon</i>,
  <i>Scapasius</i>, <i>Perascalops</i>) belong to the same family.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 9. Soricidae.</b>&mdash;The true Shrews have a much wider
  range than other families of the present order. In the Palaearctic region
  are found <i>Sorex</i>, <i>Crossopus</i>, <i>Crocidura</i>,
  <i>Nectogale</i>, <i>Chimarrogale</i>. The first is also Nearctic, and
  reaches Central America. In the Ethiopian region is the single peculiar
  genus <i>Myosorex</i>, but <i>Crocidura</i> occurs there also.
  <i>Blarina</i> and <i>Notiosorex</i> are "Sonoran" in range;
  <i>Soriculus</i> Oriental. <i>Crocidura</i>, <i>Anurosorex</i>, and
  <i>Chimarrogale</i> also enter this region. <i>Sorex</i> has teeth tipped
  with reddish colour, its dental formula being, according to Mr.
  Woodward's recent researches, I&nbsp;3/(2 or 3) C&nbsp;1/0 Pm&nbsp;3/1 M&nbsp;3/3 = 32 or
  34.</p>

  <p>As compared with other Insectivores, therefore, the most remarkable
  fact found throughout the family is the absence of the lower canines. In
  addition to this the genus may be known&mdash;the family indeed&mdash;by
  the large size of the first pair of incisors. In the above formula it is
  possible, thinks Mr. Woodward, that there may be errors; he is not
  certain whether the supposed <!-- Page 519 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page519"></a>{519}</span>upper canine may not be a fourth incisor,
  and whether the first premolar may not be really the canine. Another
  peculiar feature about the dentition of <i>Sorex</i> is the suppression
  of the teeth of the milk dentition, which are functionless, and probably
  uncalcified. The genus <i>Sorex</i> is terrestrial. The tail is long and
  covered with hairs. There are two species in this country, <i>S.
  vulgaris</i> and <i>S. minutus</i>. The former is the Shrew of legend and
  superstition; and it is no doubt the species that has lent its name to
  the more untameable members of the softer sex, though it is the males
  which are especially pugnacious. As to legend, everybody has heard of the
  shrew ash whose leaves, after a Shrew has been inserted living into a
  hole cleft in the tree, are a specific for diseases of cattle, caused by
  the Shrew itself creeping over them.</p>

  <p>The Rev. Edward Topsell, author of <i>The Historie of Four-footed
  Beastes</i>, who defends his veracity by asserting that he does not write
  "for the rude and vulgar sort, who being utterly ignorant of the
  operation of learning, do presently condemne al strange things," says of
  the Shrew that "it is a ravening beast, feigning itself gentle and tame,
  but, being touched, it biteth deep and poysoneth deadly. It beareth a
  cruel minde, desiring to hurt anything, neither is there any creature
  that it loveth, or it loveth him, because it is feared of all." It is
  probable that all this rustic feeling is due to the powerful effluvium
  which the Shrew undoubtedly emits.</p>

  <p><i>S. minutus</i> has the distinction of being the smallest British
  mammal; it is scarcer than the last. This form is found upon the Alps, as
  is also the peculiarly Alpine species <i>S. alpinus</i>, which inhabits
  the Alps, Pyrenees, Carpathians, and the Hartz.</p>

  <p><i>Crossopus fodiens</i>, the Water Shrew, has also brown-stained
  teeth. It is not uncommon in this country, and lives in burrows excavated
  by the sides of the streams which it affects.</p>

  <p>Besides these two genera, <i>Soriculus</i>, <i>Blarina</i>, and
  <i>Notiosorex</i> have red-tipped teeth. In <i>Crocidura</i>,
  <i>Myosorex</i>, <i>Diplomesodon</i>, <i>Anurosorex</i>,
  <i>Chimarrogale</i>, and <i>Nectogale</i> the teeth are white-tipped.
  These are all the genera of the family allowed by the late Dr. Dobson in
  a review of that family.<a name="NtA_382"
  href="#Nt_382"><sup>[382]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Chimarrogale</i> and <i>Nectogale</i> are aquatic genera. The
  former <!-- Page 520 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page520"></a>{520}</span>consists of a Himalayan and Bornean, and
  of a Japanese species, which have not webbed feet, but have a tail with a
  fringe of elongated hairs.</p>

  <p><i>Nectogale elegans</i> is one of the characteristic animals of the
  Thibetan plateau. It has webbed feet. The teeth are as in
  <i>Chimarrogale</i> I&nbsp;3/2 C&nbsp;1/0 Pm&nbsp;1/1 M&nbsp;3/3.</p>

  <p>The other genera are terrestrial in habit.</p>

<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 253.&mdash;<i>Galeopithecus volans.</i> × &#x2153;. (After Vogt and Specht.)</p>

  <p>The family <b>Galeopithecidae</b> contains but one genus, which has
  been at times referred to the Lemurs, to the Bats, or has been made the
  type of a special order of mammals. It is better to regard it as an
  aberrant Insectivore&mdash;so different indeed from other forms that it
  requires a special sub-order for its reception. <!-- Page 521 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page521"></a>{521}</span></p>

  <p><i>Galeopithecus</i><a name="NtA_383"
  href="#Nt_383"><sup>[383]</sup></a> inhabits the Oriental region. It is a
  larger animal than any other Insectivore, about the size of a Cat, and
  has a patagium extending between the neck and the fore-limb, between the
  fore-limb and the hind-limb, and between the hind-limb and the tail. This
  patagium is abundantly supplied with musculature, but the fingers are not
  elongated as in the Bats for its support. In the degree of its
  development, however, the patagium of this creature is midway between
  that of <i>Sciuropterus</i> on the one hand, and the Bats on the other.
  It presents many remarkable features in its organisation. The brain is
  like that of the Insectivora in the exposure of the corpora quadrigemina
  by the slight extension backward of the cerebral hemispheres; but its
  upper surface is marked by two longitudinal furrows on each side, a state
  of affairs (in combination) which is unparalleled among the Mammalia. The
  teeth are peculiar by reason of the singular "comb-like" structure of the
  lower incisors. This, however, is an exaggeration of what is to be found
  in <i>Rhynchocyon</i> and <i>Petrodromus</i>, while the same style of
  tooth, though not so highly developed, characterises certain Bats. The
  Tupaiidae and certain Lemurs show what Dr. Leche regards as the beginning
  of the same thing. As in <i>Tupaia</i> also there is an indication of the
  characteristically Lemurine sublingua. The stomach is more specialised
  than in other Insectivores, the pyloric region being extended as a
  narrowish tube. There is a caecum. A peculiarity of the intestinal tract
  is that the large intestine is longer than the small.</p>

<h5><b>Order XII. CHIROPTERA.</b></h5>

  <p>We may thus define the Bats<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span>Flying
  mammals, with the phalanges of the four digits of the hand following the
  pollex greatly elongated, and supporting between themselves and the
  hind-limbs and tail a thin integumental membrane, which forms the wing.
  The radius is long and curved; the ulna rudimentary. The knee is directed
  backwards, owing to the rotation of the limb outward by the wing
  membrane. From the inner side of the ankle-joint arises a cartilaginous
  process, the calcar, which supports the interfemoral part of the wing
  <!-- Page 522 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page522"></a>{522}</span>membrane. The mammae are thoracic; the
  placenta discoidal and deciduate. The cerebral hemispheres, which are
  smooth, do not extend over the cerebellum.</p>

      <a href="images/254.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/254.jpg"

  </div>
<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 254.&mdash;Barbastelle. <i>Synotus barbastellus.</i> × ½. (After Vogt and Specht.)</p>

  <p>This large order of mammals was once placed with the Primates. There
  is no doubt, however, that they form a perfectly distinct order; no
  knowledge of fossil forms in any way bridges over the gap which
  distinguishes them from the highest mammals. The most salient feature in
  their organisation is clearly the wings. These consist of membrane, an
  expansion of the integument, provided with nerves, blood-vessels, etc.,
  which mainly lie stretched between the digits 2 to 5. These digits
  themselves, which are enormously elongated, act like the ribs of an
  umbrella, and when the wing is folded they come into contact. Besides
  this part of the flying apparatus there is a tract of membrane lying in
  front of the arm, which corresponds to the wing membrane of the bird, but
  which in the Bats takes quite a subordinate place. In the bird, on the
  other hand, there is a metapatagium, which is the main part of the wing
  of the Bat. It seems just possible that in <i>Archaeopteryx</i> the
  metapatagium was more Bat-like. Furthermore, a steering membrane, like
  that which fringes the tail in some Pterosaurians, lies interfemorally in
  Bats, and includes the whole or a part of the tail. The pollex takes no
  share in the wing, but projects, strongly armed with a claw, from the
  upper margin.</p>

  <p>The bones of this order of mammals are slender and marrowy; they are
  thus light, and subserve the function of flight. A most remarkable
  feature among the external characters of the Bat tribe is the
  extraordinary and often highly complicated membranes which surround the
  nostrils. These are at least often <!-- Page 523 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page523"></a>{523}</span>more strongly developed
  in males than in females, and may perhaps be partly relegated to the
  category of secondary sexual characters. But it seems that they have also
  an important tactile function, and enable the creatures to fly without
  touching bodies which intrude themselves upon their way. The ears, too,
  are frequently very large, and it may be supposed that the sense of
  hearing is correspondingly acute. In the common Long-eared Bat of this
  country, the ears are not greatly inferior in length to the head and body
  of the animal combined. The ears are of every variety of shape, and offer
  characters which are valuable in the systematic arrangement of the
  members of the order.</p>

  <p>In the skull of Bats there is very rarely a complete separation
  between the orbital and temporal fossae; the lachrymal duct is outside
  the orbit. The tympanics are annular, and in a rudimentary condition. The
  centra <!-- Page 524 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page524"></a>{524}</span>of the vertebrae tend to become ankylosed
  in old individuals; the caudals have no processes, but are like those
  quite at the end of the series in long-tailed animals. The sternum is
  keeled for the better attachment of the pectoral muscles, the chief
  muscles of flight. The ribs, which are much flattened, are occasionally
  ankylosed together by their margins. There is a well-developed clavicle.
  In the carpus the scaphoid, lunar, and cuneiform are all fused together.
  In the hind-limb the fibula is rarely fully developed.</p>

  <p>The Bats are divisible into two primary groups, which are those of the
  Megachiroptera and the Microchiroptera.</p>

  <p>The <b>Pteropodidae</b> are frugivorous Bats, usually of large size.
  The chief distinguishing feature is the fact that the molars are not
  tubercular, but marked with a longitudinal furrow, which is, however,
  concealed in the genus <i>Pteralopex</i> by cusps. The palate is
  continued back behind the molars. The index finger has three phalanges,
  and is usually clawed. The ears are oval, and the two edges are in
  contact at the base of the ear. The tail, if present, has nothing to do
  with the interfemoral membrane. This group is entirely Old World in
  range. The genus <i>Pteropus</i> embraces the creatures known as Flying
  Foxes. They are the largest forms in the sub-order, sometimes having an
  expanse of wing of 5 feet (this is the case with <i>P. edulis</i>). The
  muzzle is long, and the face therefore "foxy" in appearance. <!-- Page
  525 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page525"></a>{525}</span>The inner
  margin of the nostrils projects, a preparation for the tubular nostrils
  of <i>Harpyia</i>. The tail is absent. The premolars are three and the
  molars two. The pyloric region of the stomach is extended and twisted
  upon itself. Of this genus there are nearly sixty species, extending from
  Madagascar to Queensland. Thirty species inhabit the Australian, twenty
  the Oriental region. Madagascar has seven, and one species just enters
  the Palaearctic. The occurrence of this genus in India and in Madagascar
  is one of those facts which favour the view supported, on these and other
  grounds, by Dr. Dobson and Dr. Blanford that a connexion between India
  and Madagascar must once have existed; for these slow-flying creatures
  could hardly be believed capable of traversing vast stretches of ocean by
  their unaided efforts.<a name="NtA_384"

  <p><i>Pteropus</i> is represented in the Ethiopian region by the allied
  genus <i>Epomophorus</i>. Of this there are perhaps a dozen species. The
  teeth are reduced to two premolars in the upper jaw, <!-- Page 526
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page526"></a>{526}</span>three
  remaining below; while there is but one molar in each upper jaw, and two
  in each lower. Dr. Dobson has studied the structure of the remarkable
  pharyngeal sacs which exist in the neck of the male, and are capable of
  inflation.</p>

  <p><i>Pteralopex</i> of the Solomon Islands has shorter ears than have
  many <i>Pteropus</i>, otherwise its external characters are the same. As
  in <i>Pteropus nicobaricus</i>, this genus has the orbits shut off by a
  bony ring, an extremely rare phenomenon in Bats. The canines have two
  cusps. The characters of the grinding teeth have already been mentioned.
  It is uncertain whether the only species of this genus, <i>P. atrata</i>,
  is, or is not, a vegetable feeder. <i>Harpyia</i> has shortish ears and
  extraordinarily prolonged and tubular nostrils. There is a hint of the
  accessory cusp to the canines mentioned above in <i>Pteralopex</i>. The
  incisors are reduced to one on each upper jaw, and none below.
  <i>Cynopterus</i> has also often bituberculate canines. It is an Oriental
  genus with several species.</p>

  <p><i>Nesonycteris</i>, with one species from the Solomon Islands, <i>N.
  woodfordi</i>, has the dental formula I&nbsp;2/1 C&nbsp;1/1 Pm&nbsp;3/3 M&nbsp;2/3. The index
  finger has no claw; the tail is absent. The premaxillae are separated
  anteriorly.</p>

  <p><i>Eonycteris</i>, with a single cave-dwelling species from Burmah,
  <i>E. spelaea</i>, has also no claw upon the index; the tooth formula is
  fuller by reason of the presence of an additional incisor below. The
  tongue is very long and is armed with papillae. There is a short but
  distinct tail.</p>

  <p><i>Notopteris</i>, from New Guinea and the Fiji Islands, is
  distinguished from the related genera by its long tail.</p>

  <p>The remaining genera of Fruit Bats are <i>Boneia</i>,
  <i>Harpyionycteris</i>, <i>Cephalotes</i>, <i>Callinycteris</i>, and
  <i>Macroglossus</i>, from the Oriental region, and <i>Scotonycteris</i>,
  <i>Liponyx</i>, and <i>Megaloglossus</i> from the Ethiopian region;
  finally, there is the Australian <i>Melonycteris</i>.</p>

<h5><span class="sc">Sub-Order 2.</span> MICROCHIROPTERA.</h5>

  <p>The members of this sub-order are mostly insectivorous though
  occasionally "frugivorous or sanguivorous" Bats. The molars are
  multicuspid with sharp cusps. The palate is not continued back behind the
  last molar. The second finger has but one phalanx, or <!-- Page 527
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page527"></a>{527}</span>none;
  occasionally there are two. It has no claw. The ear has its two sides
  separate from their point of origin upon the head. The group is of
  Old-World distribution.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Rhinolophidae.</b>&mdash;The Bats of this family possess
  the leafy outgrowths around the nostrils. The ears are large, but have no
  tragus. The index finger has no phalanx at all. The premaxillary bones
  are quite rudimentary, and are suspended from the nasal cartilages. In
  addition to the pectoral mammae they have two teat-like processes
  situated abdominally. The tail is long, and extends to the end of the
  interfemoral membrane.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Rhinolophus</i> has a large nose leaf, and an antitragus
  to the ear. The first toe has two joints, the remaining toes have three
  joints each. The dentition is I&nbsp;1/2 C&nbsp;1/1 Pm&nbsp;2/3 M&nbsp;3/3. There are nearly
  thirty species of the genus, which are restricted to the Old World. Two
  species occur in this country, viz. <i>R. ferrum equinum</i>, the Great
  Horse-shoe Bat, and the Lesser Horse-shoe Bat, <i>R. hipposiderus</i>.
  The name is of course derived from the shape of the nose leaf.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Hipposiderus</i> and some allied forms are placed away
  from <i>Rhinolophus</i> and its immediate allies in a sub-family
  <i>Hipposiderinae</i>. The type genus <i>Hipposiderus</i>, or, as it
  ought apparently to be called, <i>Phyllorhina</i>, is Old World in range,
  like all the other members of the family.</p>

  <p>The nose leaf is complicated, and there are only two phalanges in all
  the toes; there is no antitragus to the ear. A curious feature in the
  osteology of the genus, and indeed of the sub-family, is the fact that
  the ileo-pectineal process is connected with the ilium by a bony bridge;
  this arrangement is unique among mammals.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Anthops</i>, only known from the Solomon Islands, and
  represented there by but a single species (<i>A. ornatus</i>), has an
  extraordinarily complicated nose leaf. The tail, like that of the
  Oriental <i>Coelops</i>, likewise represented by a single species (<i>C.
  frithii</i>), is rudimentary.</p>

  <p><i>Triaenops</i>, Ethiopian and Malagasy, has, like the Australian
  <i>Rhinonycteris</i>, a well-developed tail. <i>Triaenops</i> has also a
  highly-complicated nose leaf.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Nycteridae.</b>&mdash;This family is to be distinguished
  from the Rhinolophidae by the fact that the ear has a small tragus, and
  by the small and cartilaginous premaxillae. In addition to <!-- Page 528
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page528"></a>{528}</span>these two
  characters it may be added that the nose leaf is well developed, but is
  not so complicated as in the last family. The type genus <i>Nycteris</i>
  is Ethiopian and Oriental, nine species being African, and only one,
  <i>N. javanica</i>, being, as the specific name denotes, from the East.
  <i>Megaderma</i> is to be distinguished by the loss of the upper
  incisors. There is no tail, and the ears are particularly large. They are
  carnivorous Bats, and <i>M. lyra</i>, called the "Indian Vampire Bat,"
  chiefly affects frogs as an article of diet.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Vespertilionidae.</b>&mdash;This family has not the nose
  leaf of other families. The apertures of the nostrils are simple, round,
  or crescentic apertures. The ear has a tragus, and the tail is not
  produced to any great degree behind the interfemoral membrane. There are
  two phalanges to the index digit.</p>

  <p>This family in numbers of species is vastly in excess of any other
  family of Bats. The most recent estimate, that of P. L. and W. L.
  Sclater, allows 190. But the generic types are by no means so numerous as
  in the Phyllostomatidae. This is a significant fact when we reflect upon
  the geographical range of the two families. The Vespertilionidae range
  over the whole earth, while the Phyllostomatidae are practically limited
  to the South American continent, only just getting into the Nearctic
  region. They inhabit, therefore, a more restricted area, and, in
  consequence of competition, have specialised more freely than the
  widely-spread and therefore not crowded Vespertilionidae.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Vesperugo</i> is by far the largest genus of this family,
  embracing no less than seventy species. The tail is shorter than the head
  and body together; the ears are separate, and moderate or short in size;
  the tragus is generally short and obtuse. The dentition is I&nbsp;2, C&nbsp;1, Pm&nbsp;2
  or 1, M&nbsp;3. It is a remarkable fact that this genus, unlike most Bats,
  produces two young at a time. The genus is universal in range, and one
  species, the Serotine Bat, known in this country, even ranges from the
  New World to the Old; but with so small a creature the possibility of
  accidental transportation by man must not be left out of sight. The
  British species are&mdash;<i>V. serotinus</i>, the Serotine already
  mentioned; <i>V. discolor</i>, a single example only of which has
  occurred, and may have been introduced; <i>V. noctula</i>, the habits of
  which were described by Gilbert White; <i>V. leisleri</i>; and the
  Pipistrelle, <i>V. pipistrellus</i>, which is the best-known member of
  the genus in this country.</p>

<p><!-- Page 529 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page529"></a>{529}</span></p>

  <p>The genus <i>Vespertilio</i> contains some forty-five species, and is
  world-wide in range. It has one more premolar in the upper jaw than has
  <i>Vesperugo</i>. There are no less than six British species, of which
  <i>V. murinus</i> is the largest species of Bat recorded from this
  country, but is not quite certainly indigenous.</p>

  <p><i>Plecotus</i> has very long ears. The dentition is I&nbsp;2/3 C&nbsp;1/1
  Pm&nbsp;2/3 M&nbsp;3/3. The tragus is very large. There are but two or possibly
  three species, of which one is North American, and the other is the
  Long-eared Bat, <i>P. auritus</i>, of this country, but ranging as far as
  India. The shrill voice, inaudible to some ears, of this Bat has been
  heard <i>of</i> by everybody.</p>

  <p><i>Synotus</i> includes the British Barbastelle, <i>S.
  barbastellus</i>, as well as an Eastern form. It differs from the last
  genus principally by the loss of a lower premolar. The ears, too, are not
  so large. <i>Otonycteris</i>, <i>Nyctophilus</i>, and <i>Antrozous</i>
  are allied genera; the last is Californian, the others Old-World
  forms.</p>

  <p><i>Kerivoula</i> (or <i>Cerivoula</i>) has a long, pointed, narrow
  tragus. The tail is as long as or longer than the head and body. The
  dentition is as in <i>Vespertilio</i>; but the upper incisors are
  parallel instead of divergent as in that genus. The brilliantly-coloured
  <i>K. picta</i> is, on account of this very fact, the best-known species.
  The name <i>Kerivoula</i>, a corruption of the Cinghalese "Kehel vulha,"
  signifies plantain bat. This Bat has been described as looking, when
  disturbed in the daytime, more like a huge butterfly than a Bat, which is
  naturally associated with sombre hues. Other species occur in the
  Oriental, Australian, and Ethiopian regions.</p>

  <p><i>Miniopterus</i> has a premolar less in the upper jaw; it has a long
  tail as in the last genus. One species, <i>M. scheibersi</i>, has almost
  the widest range of any Bat, it being found from South Europe to Africa,
  Asia, Madagascar, and Australia.</p>

  <p><i>Natalus</i> is an allied form from Tropical America and the West
  Indies. It is chiefly to be separated from <i>Kerivoula</i> by the short
  tragus to the ear.</p>

  <p><i>Thyroptera</i> is also South American. It is distinguished by the
  curious sucker-like discs upon the thumb and foot. These "resemble in
  miniature the sucking cups of cuttle-fishes." The Madagascar genus,
  <i>Myxopoda</i>, with but one species, has also an adhesive but
  horse-shoe-shaped pad upon the thumb and foot.</p>

  <p><i>Scotophilus</i> has shortish ears with a tapering tragus. The tail
  is shorter than the head and body, and is nearly contained within <!--
  Page 530 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page530"></a>{530}</span>the
  interfemoral membrane. The dentition is I&nbsp;1/3 C&nbsp;1/1 Pm&nbsp;1/2 M&nbsp;3/3, with
  another upper incisor in the young. It is African, Asiatic, and
  Australian.</p>

  <p>This genus appears to be connected with <i>Vesperugo</i> by Mr.
  Dobson's proposed genus, or sub-genus as it is generally held to be,
  <i>Scotozous</i>.<a name="NtA_385" href="#Nt_385"><sup>[385]</sup></a>
  The genus <i>Nycticejus</i>, founded for the inclusion of <i>Scotozous
  dormeri</i>, an Indian species, should, according to Dr. Blanford,
  replace on grounds of priority the name <i>Scotophilus</i>. But as this
  name (<i>Nycticejus</i>) is one introduced by Rafinesque, whose work was
  so uncertain and untrustworthy, it seems preferable to retain the
  better-known name of <i>Scotophilus</i>, introduced by William Elford
  Leach.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Chalinolobus</i><a name="NtA_386"
  href="#Nt_386"><sup>[386]</sup></a> has short, broad ears with an
  expanded tragus. A distinct fleshy lobule projects from the lower lip on
  either side of the mouth. The tail is as long as the head and the body.
  The dental formula is I&nbsp;2/3 C&nbsp;1/1 Pm&nbsp;2/2 or 1/2 M&nbsp;3/3. The genus occurs
  in Africa, Australia, and New Zealand; but the African species, with
  diminished premolars and pale coloration, have been distinguished as
  <i>Glauconycteris</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Emballonuridae.</b>&mdash;The Bats belonging to this family
  have no nose leaf. The tragus is present, but often very small. The ears
  in this family are often united. There are two phalanges in the middle
  finger. The tail is partly free, either perforating the interfemoral
  membrane and appearing upon its upper surface, or prolonged beyond its
  end. The face is obliquely truncated in front, the nostrils appearing
  beyond the lower lip.</p>

  <p><i>Emballonura</i> is Australian, Oriental, and Mascarene in range.
  The ears arise separately, and there is a fairly developed and narrow
  tragus. The tail perforates the interfemoral membrane. The dental formula
  is I&nbsp;2/3 C&nbsp;1/1 Pm&nbsp;2/2 M&nbsp;3/3.</p>

  <p><i>Rhinopoma</i> has the ears united; the incisors are reduced by one
  on each side of each jaw, and the premolars are similarly reduced, but
  only in the upper jaw.</p>

  <p><i>Noctilio</i> is an American genus of two or three species, which
  has one pair of markedly large upper incisors, which completely conceal
  the outer pair. On these grounds this Bat was removed from its allies and
  placed by Linnaeus among the Rodents, an instance of the disadvantage of
  the artificial scheme of classification. The species named <i>N.
  leporinus</i> has been shown to feed upon fish. <!-- Page 531 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page531"></a>{531}</span></p>

  <p><i>Furia</i>, <i>Amorphochilus</i>, <i>Rhynchonycteris</i>,
  <i>Saccopteryx</i>, <i>Cormura</i>, and <i>Diclidurus</i> are other
  Neotropical genera of the same family.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Taphozous</i><a name="NtA_387"
  href="#Nt_387"><sup>[387]</sup></a> has a tail which perforates the
  interfemoral membrane, appearing on its upper surface; it is capable of
  being withdrawn. The premaxillaries are cartilaginous. The dentition is
  I&nbsp;1/2 C&nbsp;1/1 Pm&nbsp;2/2 M&nbsp;3/3. The upper incisors often disappear. Many
  species of the genus have a gular sac, opening anteriorly between the
  jaws. This is better developed in the males. The genus ranges from Africa
  through Asia to New Guinea and Australia. There are some twelve
  species.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Molossus</i><a name="NtA_388"
  href="#Nt_388"><sup>[388]</sup></a> has short legs and well-developed
  fibulae. The tail is thick and fleshy, and is prolonged far beyond the
  margin of the interfemoral membrane. The ears are united together above
  the nose; the tragus is minute. The dentition is I&nbsp;1/1 or 1/2 C&nbsp;1/1
  Pm&nbsp;1/2 or 2/2 M&nbsp;3/3. This genus, which is confined to the tropical and
  subtropical portions of America, has long and narrow wings. The Bats can
  thus fly rapidly, twist about with ease, and capture strongly-flying
  insects. There are a large number of species.</p>

  <p><i>Nyctinomus</i> is an allied genus, and also has many species. These
  range through both hemispheres. The chief differences from
  <i>Molossus</i> are that the premaxillary bones are separate in front or
  united by cartilage, and that the incisors may be three in the lower
  jaw.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 5. Phyllostomatidae.</b>&mdash;The Bats of this family are
  extremely numerous and almost entirely confined to South America. None of
  them occur outside the New World. There are some thirty-five genera. The
  members of the family are to be distinguished by the presence of the nose
  leaf, by the well-developed premaxillae, and by the possession of three
  phalanges by the middle finger. They are large, and the tragus of the ear
  is well developed.</p>

  <p><i>Vampyrus</i> of South America contains the large species V.
  spectrum, which, mainly on account as it seems of its "forbidding
  aspect," was supposed to be a bloodsucker. This genus has two incisors on
  each side of the upper jaw.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Glossophaga</i> represents another type of structure in
  this family. The tongue is long and extensile, and is much attenuated
  towards the tip, where it is covered with strong and recurved papillae.
  This structure was at one time thought to indicate a <!-- Page 532
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page532"></a>{532}</span>bloodsucking
  habit; but its use appears to be merely that of scooping out the soft
  insides of fruits, upon which the Bat mainly lives. The incisors are only
  one on each side of the upper jaw. The really bloodsucking Bats of this
  family belong to the genera <i>Desmodus</i> and <i>Diphylla</i>. The
  former is the Vampire, the species being known as <i>Desmodus rufus</i>.
  These Bats have no tail; there is no true molar tooth; the canines are
  large, and the single pair of upper incisors quite caniniform, and very
  sharp and strong. These are the main teeth for aggression. In accordance
  with its diet of blood, the Vampire has a peculiarly modified intestine.
  The gullet is provided with a bore so small that nothing but fluid food
  could pass down it; the stomach is intestiniform in shape.</p>

<h5 class="lg150">CHAPTER XVII</h5>

<h6>PRIMATES</h6>

<h5><b>Order XIII. PRIMATES.</b></h5>

  <p>The highest of mammals, the Primates,<a name="NtA_389"
  href="#Nt_389"><sup>[389]</sup></a> may be thus differentiated from other
  groups<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span>Completely hairy, generally
  arboreal mammals, with five digits on fore- and hind-limbs, provided with
  flat nails (except in the case of certain Lemurs and the Marmosets), the
  phalanges that bear these being flattened at the extremity and expanded
  rather than diminished in size. The fore-feet are grasping hands as a
  rule, and the hind-feet walking as well as (generally) grasping organs,
  and the mode of progression is plantigrade. The teats, except in
  <i>Chiromys</i>, are thoracic, and even axillary in position. The skull
  is characterised by the fact that the orbital and the temporal vacuities
  are, at least partly, separated by bone. The clavicles are always
  present. The carpus has separate lunar and scaphoid bones, and the
  centrale is often present. There is rarely an entepicondylar foramen in
  the humerus, except in some archaic Lemurs. The femur has no third
  trochanter. The stomach is usually simple, being sacculated only in
  Semnopithecinae. The caecum is always present, and often large.</p>

  <p>This great group could be easily divided into two separate orders, the
  Apes and the Lemurs, if it were not for certain fossil types. As will be
  seen from the description of <i>Nesopithecus</i> and of <i>Tarsius</i>,
  the actual hard and fast lines between <i>all</i> Apes and <i>all</i>
  Lemurs are very few. On the other hand, it is a little difficult to draw
  a hard and fast line between the Primates as a whole&mdash;or at least
  between the Lemurine section&mdash;and the Creodonta, a <!-- Page 534
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page534"></a>{534}</span>group to which
  so many others appear to converge. It is disputed, for example, whether
  the Chriacidae among extinct Lemurs are rightly placed, or whether they
  should be referred to the Creodonta. The number of primitive characters
  seen among the Primates, even in Man himself, is remarkable. Of these the
  more important are the five digits of both limbs and the plantigrade
  walk, the presence of clavicles and of a centrale, and the absence of a
  third trochanter. All these features distinguish the early Eutheria.</p>

<h5><span class="sc">Sub-Order 1.</span> LEMUROIDEA.<a name="NtA_390" href="#Nt_390"><sup>[390]</sup></a></h5>

  <p>The animals known as Lemurs, from their nocturnal and ghostly habits,
  are on a lower level of organisation than the other division of the
  Primates. Even the external form enables the members of the present
  sub-order to be readily distinguished from the higher Anthropoidea. The
  head is more like that of a Fox, with a sharp muzzle; it lacks the human
  expression of the face of even the lower among the Apes. The long tail is
  never prehensile, and there is never any trace of cheek pouches or of
  integumental callosities, which are frequently so characteristic of the
  Apes. The Lemurs agree with the remainder of the Primates in having
  pectoral mammae (sometimes abdominal ones are present in addition, and in
  <i>Hapalemur</i>&mdash;in the male at least&mdash;there is a mamma upon
  each shoulder), in having opposable thumbs and toes, and in the flattened
  digits. The tail varies from complete absence (in the <i>Loris</i>) to a
  great length and bushiness in the Aye-aye. The pectoral limbs are always
  shorter than the hind-limbs; the reverse is occasionally the case in the
  Anthropoidea. A curious contrast between the two divisions of the
  Primates concerns the digits of the hands and feet. In the Anthropoidea
  it is the hallux or pollex which is subject to great variation. In the
  Lemurs, on the contrary, the thumb and great toe are always well
  developed, but the second or the third digit constantly shows some
  abnormality; thus the singular elongation of the third digit of the hand
  in <i>Chiromys</i> and the absence of the index in the <i>Potto</i>.<a
  name="NtA_391" href="#Nt_391"><sup>[391]</sup></a> In all Lemurs the <!--
  Page 535 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page535"></a>{535}</span>second toe is furnished with a sharp nail,
  unlike the flattened nails of the other fingers and toes, and in
  <i>Tarsius</i> the third also is thus provided. As to osteology, the
  shape of the head, already referred to, indicates some of the differences
  in the skull which mark off the Lemurs from the Anthropoidea. The brain
  case is small relatively to the face; the orbital and temporal fossae are
  in communication, though the frontal and jugal bones are united behind
  the orbit. The two halves of the lower jaw are not invariably ossified to
  form one piece, as is the case with most Apes. The lachrymal foramen lies
  upon the face in front of the orbit. The teeth are characteristic, not so
  much in their number (the dental formula is usually I&nbsp;2, C&nbsp;1, Pm&nbsp;3, M&nbsp;3 =
  36) as in the disposition of the incisors. The incisors of the lower jaw
  and the canines project forwards in a way only found in a few American
  Monkeys; as in the Apes there are four incisors in each jaw, but, with
  the exception of the highly aberrant <i>Chiromys</i>, there is a space in
  the upper jaw between the incisors of the two sides. The canines of the
  lower jaw, moreover, are often incisiform. There is a well-developed
  sublingua beneath the tongue (see p. <a href="#page61">61</a>). The
  stomach is perfectly simple; and the caecum, always present and varying
  in length, never has a vermiform appendix. The gall-bladder is always
  present. The brain differs from that of the Anthropoidea in that the
  cerebellum is, as in the lower Mammalia, exposed. The convolutions upon
  the cerebral hemispheres are not greatly developed, a circumstance,
  however, which (see p. <a href="#page77">77</a>) may have more relation
  to the size of the animals than to their mental development. Though the
  brain in its general outlines is not like that of the other Primates,
  there are certain resemblances; the most striking of these is perhaps the
  presence, though in rather a rudimentary condition, of the "Simian
  fissure."</p>

  <p>The Lemurine brain has been chiefly studied by Flower,<a
  name="NtA_392" href="#Nt_392"><sup>[392]</sup></a> by Milne-Edwards,<a
  name="NtA_393" href="#Nt_393"><sup>[393]</sup></a> and by myself.<a
  name="NtA_394" href="#Nt_394"><sup>[394]</sup></a> There are also a
  number of scattered papers dealing with particular types, such as the
  memoirs of Owen<a name="NtA_395" href="#Nt_395"><sup>[395]</sup></a> and
  Oudemans,<a name="NtA_396" href="#Nt_396"><sup>[396]</sup></a> upon the
  brain (and the general anatomy) of <i>Chiromys</i>. Without going into
  great <!-- Page 536 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page536"></a>{536}</span>detail it may be stated generally that the
  anatomy of the brain of this group confirms the classification which is
  adopted in this work.</p>

  <p>A curious feature in the anatomy of the Lemurs, which they share with
  animals so remote from them in the system as the Edentata, is the
  breaking up of some of the arteries of the limbs to form retia mirabilia;
  nothing of the kind is known among the other Primates.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the most remarkable difference between the Lemurs and the
  Anthropoidea, which are really in many respects more closely allied than
  might be inferred from the above summary of differences, is in the
  structure of the placenta. The Lemurs agree with the Ungulates in having
  a non-deciduate placenta.</p>

  <p>A curious feature confined to the sub-family Lemurinae was first
  discovered by myself in <i>Hapalemur griseus</i>.<a name="NtA_397"
  href="#Nt_397"><sup>[397]</sup></a> On the forearm (see Fig. 258) is an
  area of hardened skin, which is raised into spine-like processes. Fully
  developed, this organ is characteristic of the male, the area being
  marked off in the female, but without the spiny outgrowths. On removing
  the skin a gland about the size and shape of an almond is brought into
  view. In other Lemurs there is no modified skin, but a small tuft of
  particularly long hairs, which are also present in <i>Hapalemur</i>, and
  a small gland beneath the skin. The gland of <i>Hapalemur</i> may be
  comparable with a tract of hardened skin in <i>Lemur catta</i>, which
  projects to a large extent and has been spoken of as a "climbing
  organ."</p>

  <p>An almost exactly similar tuft of spine-like outgrowths exists upon
  the lower end of the ankle of <i>Galago garnetti</i>. The spines are
  black and bent, just as they are in <i>Hapalemur</i>. There appears also
  to be a gland. This structure is not universal in the genus <i>Galago</i>
  any more than is the patch of spines in the genus <i>Hapalemur</i>.</p>

  <p>In addition to this gland and to the patch of spines which cover it,
  the same Lemur as well as <i>Chirogaleus</i> and certain species of
  <i>Lemur</i> possess to the inner side of it a bundle of long and stiff
  bristles associated with unusually large sebaceous glands; these
  structures are, of course, not homologous with the gland of the arm of
  <i>Hapalemur</i>, as they coexist in the same <!-- Page 537 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page537"></a>{537}</span>species. They are,
  moreover, not peculiar to the Lemurs, but exist in the Squirrel, in the
  Domestic Cat, in the Leopard, in <i>Bassaricyon</i>,<a name="NtA_398"
  href="#Nt_398"><sup>[398]</sup></a> the Otter, various Marsupials, and
  doubtless in many mammals which require a tactile organ, for these hairs
  are associated with a large branch of the radial nerve.</p>

  <p>The Lemurs have at the present time a most remarkable distribution.
  There are altogether about fifty species, referable to seventeen genera.
  Thirty-six species are confined to Madagascar <!-- Page 538 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page538"></a>{538}</span>and to some small
  neighbouring islands. The rest occur in the Ethiopian and in the Oriental
  region. The rest of the world is at present totally without Lemurs,
  though, as will be seen in the sequel, the order was more widely spread
  over the globe in past times.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Lemuridae.</b>&mdash;This family can be usefully subdivided
  into four sub-families.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 1. Indrisinae.</b>&mdash;This sub-family is limited to
  Madagascar, and has been exhaustively treated of by M. Grandidier and
  Professor Milne-Edwards in the <i>Histoire de Madagascar</i>. These
  Lemurs contrast with others by the large size of the hind- as compared
  with the fore-limbs. The ears are short. The tail varies in length. The
  thumb is but slightly opposable, and the toes are webbed. Correlated with
  the first two of these characters, these Lemurs when upon the ground
  progress by means of the hind-limbs, holding their arms above their
  heads. The number of teeth is reduced, the total being thirty. The
  formula<a name="NtA_400" href="#Nt_400"><sup>[400]</sup></a> is I&nbsp;2/2
  C&nbsp;1/0 Pm&nbsp;2/2 M&nbsp;3/3. The colon or large intestine, as figured by
  Milne-Edwards, has a remarkable watch-spring-like coil, highly suggestive
  of the Ruminants and of certain Rodents. This, however, is only in
  <i>Propithecus</i> and <i>Avahis</i>. The caecum in this sub-family is
  specially large. The brain is characterised by the comparatively slight
  development of the angular fissure in <i>Propithecus</i> and
  <i>Avahis</i>; it is in them anterior in position. In <i>Indris</i> it is
  more <img src="images/s.png" class="middle" style="height:2ex;" alt="S"
  />-shaped and larger as in <i>Lemur</i>. The parieto-occipital fissure is
  fairly well developed, so too is the antero-temporal.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Indris</i> has more pronounced external ears than have
  the two other genera of the sub-family. The tail is rudimentary. The
  incisors of the upper jaw are sub-equal and set close together, those of
  the lower jaw have marked longitudinal ridges upon the outer surface,
  which suggests <i>Galeopithecus</i> (see p. <a href="#page520">520</a>).
  The molars are quadricuspidate. There is but a single species, <i>I.
  brevicaudata</i>, which is of a black colour, diversified with white upon
  the rump and the limbs. The term "Indri"<a name="NtA_401"
  href="#Nt_401"><sup>[401]</sup></a> means, as does "Aye-aye," "look." One
  of the native names for the <!-- Page 539 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page539"></a>{539}</span>animal, "Amboanala," signifies "dog of the
  forest," and is derived not only from the woeful howls of the creature,
  but from the fact that in certain parts of the island it is used as a dog
  to chase birds.</p>

  <p>These howls are largely effected by means of a laryngeal pouch, which
  is described as different from that of Apes; the mechanism must also
  differ from that of <i>Megaladapis</i>, inasmuch as the lower jaw is not
  deep as in that extinct Lemur. The Indri is the largest of Lemurs,
  measuring about two feet in length. It is arboreal and social, travelling
  in large companies. As is the case with the <i>Propithecus</i>, the
  natives of Madagascar hold the Indri in awe and veneration. It is curious
  that the name Lemur or ghost is peculiarly applicable to the Indri or
  Babakote in another sense from that which led to its adoption by
  Linnaeus. The natives, in fact, believe that men after death become
  Indris. Naturally, therefore, these Lemurs have reaped the advantage of
  this superstition in almost perfect immunity from destruction. Their
  "long-drawn-out, melancholy cries" are probably at the root of much of
  the ghostly terrors which they inspire.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Avahis</i><a name="NtA_402"
  href="#Nt_402"><sup>[402]</sup></a> has but a single species, <i>A.
  laniger</i>, which is the smallest of this sub-family. It is a foot long
  without the tail. The Avahi has a long tail (15 inches in length) like
  <i>Propithecus</i>. The outer incisors are larger than the inner, thus
  differentiating the genus from <i>Propithecus</i>. The molars of the
  upper jaw are quadricuspidate, of the lower jaw five cusped. This genus
  has only eleven pairs of ribs instead of the twelve of <i>Indris</i> and
  <i>Propithecus</i>. The Avahis, unlike the Sifakas and Indrinas, lead a
  solitary life, or go about in pairs. They are, moreover, completely
  nocturnal.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Propithecus</i> is characterised by the fur being rather
  silky than woolly, which latter is the kind of fur found in the two other
  genera of the sub-family. They are also rather larger animals, the body
  reaching a length of nearly 2 feet. The tail is long as in <i>Avahis</i>;
  the inner incisors are larger than the outer. The "Sifakas," as these
  Lemurs are termed, have a reputation for gentleness of character, but, as
  is the case with other animals, the males fight for the possession of the
  females at the breeding season. They are mainly vegetarian in habit, and
  travel in large companies. There are at least three species, and <!--
  Page 540 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page540"></a>{540}</span>several varieties are allowed. The colours
  of these Lemurs are bright, and distributed so as to form contrasting
  bands; thus <i>P. coquereli</i>, a variety of <i>P. verreauxi</i>, has a
  black face and a body mainly white, with splashes of a rich maroon upon
  the limbs and upon the chest.</p>

  <p>These Lemurs are diurnal, and are especially active in the early
  morning and evening, sleeping, or at any rate remaining quiet, during the
  heat of the day. Their fitness for an arboreal life is shown by the
  existence of a parachute-like fold of skin between the arms and the body,
  which suggests a commencement of the more complete parachute of Flying
  Foxes, etc. These Lemurs are said to be reverenced and therefore shielded
  from injury by the natives of Madagascar.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 2. Lemurinae.</b>&mdash;The "True Lemurs" are all
  inhabitants of Madagascar and of the Comoro Islands. They have not such
  long hind-limbs as have the members of the last sub-family, nor are the
  toes webbed. The tooth formula differs from that of the Indrisinae in
  that there is one more premolar on each side of the upper jaw, and often
  one more incisor in the lower jaw, making thus a total of thirty-six
  teeth. Sometimes, however, the incisors of the upper jaw are totally
  wanting.</p>

  <p>The Hattock, genus <i>Mixocebus</i>, is a scarce creature, only known
  from a single species, <i>M. caniceps</i>. As it is rare, nothing is
  known of its habits. It has one pair of upper incisors. The creature is
  one foot and half an inch long, exclusive of the tail, which is an inch
  longer than the body.</p>

  <p>Genus <i>Lepilemur</i>.&mdash;The Lemurs belonging to this genus,
  entirely confined to Madagascar, as are all the Lemurinae, have received
  the perfectly unnecessary and pseudo-vernacular name of "Sportive
  Lemurs"; an equally inappropriate and not at all ingenious name of
  "Gentle Lemurs" being bestowed upon the allied genus <i>Hapalemur</i>. In
  <i>Lepilemur</i> there are seven species, which are to be distinguished
  from <i>Mixocebus</i> in having the tail shorter than the body. There are
  no incisors in the upper jaw. The last molar is tricuspidate in the upper
  jaw; that of the lower jaw has five cusps. They are nocturnal creatures,
  and but little is known of their habits. Previously to Dr. Forsyth
  Major's visit to Madagascar only two species of the genus were known; he
  has added five others. The length of the body is 14 inches, and that of
  the tail 10 inches, in <i>L. mustelinus</i>, which is the largest
  species. <!-- Page 541 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page541"></a>{541}</span></p>

  <p>The genus <i>Hapalemur</i><a name="NtA_403"
  href="#Nt_403"><sup>[403]</sup></a> has a shorter muzzle than
  <i>Lemur</i>, and shorter ears. There are two pairs of mammae instead of
  only one; these are upon the breast and abdomen. In the male there is a
  pair upon the shoulder. The incisors are small, sub-equal, and placed one
  behind the other; the last one is at the inside of the canines. The
  molars of the upper jaw and the last premolar have only three well-marked
  cusps; in the lower jaw they have four. The caecum is blunter and is not
  so long as in <i>Lemur</i>; it differs from that of other Lemurinae in
  having only two supporting mesenteries, which are both furnished with
  blood-vessels. As in <i>Lepilemur</i> and the Indrisinae the carpus has
  no os centrale.</p>

  <p>The genus, which is confined to the island of Madagascar, has two
  species, of which one, <i>H. simus</i>, is the larger and has a broader
  muzzle, and does not possess the peculiar arm gland (Fig. 258) already
  described in <i>H. griseus</i>. The former species is stated by Mr. Shaw
  to be chiefly a grass-eater, and to dislike berries and fruits, which are
  usually so popular with Lemurs. It is, however, believed by some that
  there is but one species of <i>Hapalemur</i>. <i>H. griseus</i> is 15
  inches long, and has a tail of the same length. Its native name is
  "Bokombouli." It is nocturnal, and is especially addicted to bamboos,
  upon the shoots of which it feeds and among which it lives. It is often
  exhibited in the Zoological Society's Gardens; but the specimens seem to
  be always males. This Lemur is of a dark iron-grey colour with a tinge of
  yellow, more marked in individuals which have received the separate
  specific name of <i>H. olivaceus</i>.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Lemur</i> is distinguished by the long tail, half as long
  as the body at the least, by the elongated face, and by the Fox-like
  muzzle; the teeth are present to the full number of the family, viz.
  thirty-six; the incisors are small and equal in size, and are separated
  from each other and from the canines by spaces. The molars of the upper
  jaw have five cusps, but there are only four in the lower jaw.</p>

  <p>This genus is entirely confined to Madagascar and the Comoro Islands,
  and consists of several species, the exact number of which is doubtful.
  Wallace in his <i>Geographical Distribution</i> allows fifteen; Dr.
  Forbes only eight, with a plentiful allowance of varieties. One of the
  best-known species is <i>Lemur catta</i>, the <!-- Page 542 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page542"></a>{542}</span>Ring-tailed Lemur, or
  the "Madagascar Cat" of sailors. <i>Lemur macaco</i> shows a remarkable
  sexual dimorphism, the male being black, and the female&mdash;formerly
  described as a distinct species, <i>L. leucomystax</i>&mdash;being
  reddish brown with white whiskers and ear tufts. This led to a confusion
  with a totally distinct species, <i>L. rufipes</i>, of which the male
  (regarded as distinct and called <i>L. nigerrimus</i>) is entirely black.
  This latter identification is, however, considered by Dr. Forsyth Major<a
  name="NtA_404" href="#Nt_404"><sup>[404]</sup></a> to be not quite
  certain at present.</p>

  <p>The young Lemur is at least sometimes carried by the mother across her
  belly; its tail passes round her back and then round its own neck.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:42%;">
      <a href="images/259.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/259.jpg"

<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 259.&mdash;Ruffed Lemur. <i>Lemur varius.</i> × <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">9</span>.</p>

  <p>The Lemurs of this genus agree with those of some other genera in the
  loudness of their voice, which is constantly exercised. Some move about
  by day and others by night. They are insectivorous and carnivorous as
  well as vegetarian; and Mr. Lydekker suggests<a name="NtA_405"
  href="#Nt_405"><sup>[405]</sup></a> that their abundance and hardiness is
  to be traced to this fondness for a mixed diet. <i>Lemur catta</i> seems
  to be the only member of the genus that is not arboreal. It lives among
  rocks where but few trees, and those much stunted, occur. Many species of
  <i>Lemur</i> are always to be seen in the Zoological Society's Gardens.
  Fourteen "species" have at one time or another been exhibited.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 3. Galagininae.</b>&mdash;This sub-family is found on the
  continent of Africa as well as in Madagascar; but the genera are <!--
  Page 543 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page543"></a>{543}</span>different in the two districts. In
  Madagascar we have <i>Opolemur</i>, <i>Microcebus</i>, and
  <i>Chirogale</i>; on the continent, <i>Galago</i>. The members of this
  sub-family have markedly large ears, which are but little furry; the tail
  is long. A very marked skeletal character distinguishes this sub-family
  from other Lemuridae, and allies them to <i>Tarsius</i>, that is the
  lengthening of the calcaneum and naviculare in the ankle. The dental
  formula is as in <i>Lemur</i>. The supporting bands of the caecum are in
  this sub-family as in the genus <i>Lemur</i>. There are but two folds, of
  which one is median and non-vascular; the lateral fold bears a
  blood-vessel, and is joined by the median frenum. The brain is but little
  known. The only figure of the brain of <i>Galago</i> is one by myself.
  There are four mammae, two on the breast and two upon the abdomen.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Galago</i> comprises at any rate six distinct species.
  They are all African, and range right across the continent from Abyssinia
  as far south as Natal, and to Senegambia in the west. The incisors of the
  upper jaw are small and equal; there is a gap between the canine and the
  first premolar. The molars and the last premolar have four cusps; the
  last molar of the lower jaw has an additional fifth cusp as in
  <i>Macacus</i>, etc. The Galagos are chiefly nocturnal, and are more or
  less omnivorous. Owing to their long hind-legs these animals when they
  leave the trees advance upon the ground by hops like a Kangaroo.
  <i>Galago senegalensis</i> makes a nest in the fork of two branches,
  where it sleeps during the day. The Great Galago (<i>G.
  crassicaudatus</i>) is named by the Portuguese "Rat of the Cocoa-nut
  Palm." Sir John Kirk, after whom a variety of this species is called,
  relates that it is incapable of resisting the fascinations of palm wine,
  upon which it will readily intoxicate itself, and as a consequence brave
  probable captivity. I have referred above (p. <a href="#page536">536</a>)
  to the patch of spines upon the tarsus of <i>G. garnetti</i>.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Chirogale</i> is entirely confined to Madagascar. It is
  to be distinguished from <i>Galago</i> by the fact that the inner
  incisors are larger than the outer. There are five species of the genus
  known: four previously to Dr. Forsyth Major's recent visit to Madagascar,
  and a fifth brought back by him.<a name="NtA_406"
  href="#Nt_406"><sup>[406]</sup></a> In connexion with this genus the
  naturalist just mentioned has observed that all the Lemurs of Madagascar,
  including the aberrant <!-- Page 544 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page544"></a>{544}</span><i>Chiromys</i>, differ from the African
  forms by the fact that the tympanic ring "is completely enclosed by the
  bulla ossea, but without osseous connexion with the same." This character
  he thinks so important as to justify the inclusion of all the Mascarene
  forms in one group as opposed to another group consisting of the
  continental Lemurs. In this event <i>Chirogale</i> will have to be
  separated from its close association with <i>Galago</i>. For the present,
  however, it is left in the more generally accepted position.</p>

  </div>
<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 261.&mdash;Mouse Lemur. <i>Chirogale coquereli.</i> × ½.</p>

  <p><i>Microcebus</i> contains the most minute among the Lemurs. <i>M.
  smithii</i> has a body only 5 inches long, the tail being another 6
  inches. It occurs in Madagascar, and includes five species.</p>

  <p><i>Opolemur</i>, the Fat-tailed Lemur, was so called on account of a
  <!-- Page 545 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page545"></a>{545}</span>deposit of fat formed chiefly at the root
  of the tail, and intended to tide over the time of the creature's
  hibernation. But, as a matter of fact, this peculiarity also exists in
  <i>Chirogale</i>. Of <i>Opolemur</i> but two species are known, and of
  one of these, named after Mr. Thomas of the British Museum, only three
  examples are in existence in museums, that is to say in one
  museum&mdash;our own at South Kensington. Many of these dwarf Lemurs are
  exceedingly rare. In this genus and in the last two the palate has a pair
  of posterior fenestrae, of which there are also traces in other Lemurs,
  but which are particularly large in <i>Microcebus</i>. This is, of
  course, a well-known character of the Marsupials, and also, which is more
  important in the present connexion, of certain Insectivores.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 4. Lorisinae.</b>&mdash;This sub-family is the only one
  with a wide distribution, and it contains, with the exception of
  <i>Tarsius</i>, the only Asiatic members of the group. Correlated with
  its wide distribution there is more divergence in anatomical characters
  than is the case with the other sub-families of the Lemuridae. In
  external features all the three genera of this sub-family agree in their
  small size, their short or entirely deficient tail, large staring eyes,
  and the rudimentary character, or absence, of the index finger, which is
  never provided with a nail; in all of them the thumb diverges widely from
  the other fingers, and the great toe is so divergent as to be directed
  backwards. In the brain there is one character common to all three
  genera, and that is the small length of the angular fissure. The caecum,
  which is long, is supported by three folds, of which the median is
  anangious, and is sometimes attached to the longer of the two lateral
  folds, which are vascular. The members of this sub-family have more
  dorsal vertebrae than are found in other Lemurs; the range is from
  fourteen in <i>Loris</i>, to sixteen in <i>Nycticebus</i>.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Nycticebus</i> contains only a single species, <i>N.
  tardigradus</i>, though four other names have been given to supposed
  varieties. Moreover, the genus itself has been named <i>Stenops</i>, as
  also the next genus <i>Loris</i>. The body of this animal is stouter than
  that of the next to be described. Professor Mivart has pointed out that,
  though Asiatic like the Loris, it presents more resemblances to the
  African Potto. The index finger is small; the inner of the two incisors
  is smaller than the outer, but both of one side are close together. They
  may be reduced to one on each side of the upper jaw. <!-- Page 546
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page546"></a>{546}</span></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:38%;">
      <a href="images/262.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/262.jpg"

  </div>
<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 262.&mdash;Slow Loris. <i>Nycticebus tardigradus.</i> × &#x2153;.</p>

  <p>The animal has a wide distribution in the East, occurring in Assam and
  Burmah, the Malay Peninsula, Siam, and Cochin-China, Sumatra, Java,
  Borneo, and the Philippines. Its vernacular names signify "Bashful Cat"
  and "Bashful Monkey" in allusion to its nocturnal and shy habits. It
  lives among trees, which it does not voluntarily leave. Its movements are
  deliberate, as its popular name, Slow Loris, implies; but it makes up for
  this by a vigorous tenacity of grasp. The animals "make a curious
  chattering when angry, and when pleased at night they utter a short
  though tuneful whistle of one unvaried note, which is thought by Chinese
  sailors to presage wind." Much superstition has collected round this
  harmless though rather weird-looking creature. Its influence over human
  beings is as active when it is dead as when it is alive. "Thus," writes
  Mr. Stanley Flower,<a name="NtA_407" href="#Nt_407"><sup>[407]</sup></a>
  "a Malay may commit a crime he did not premeditate, and then find that an
  enemy had buried a particular part of a loris under his threshold, which
  had, unknown to him, compelled him to act to his own disadvantage." The
  life of the Loris, adds Mr. Flower, <!-- Page 547 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page547"></a>{547}</span>"is not a happy one,
  for it is continually seeing ghosts; and that is why it hides its face in
  its hands!"</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Perodicticus</i> contains two quite recognisable species,
  known respectively as the Angwantibo and Bosman's Potto. The former has
  been regarded as referable to a distinct genus, <i>Arctocebus</i>. A
  curious internal character of the Potto which is visible, or at least can
  be felt, externally, is the long neural processes of the cervical
  vertebrae, which project beyond the level of the skin. The index finger
  is rudimentary and so is the tail, being only just visible (about an inch
  in length) in the Potto. The colour of both genera is a reddish grey,
  redder in the Potto. The incisors are equal and minute. Both species are
  confined in their range to West Africa, and are arboreal like the other
  members of the sub-family. The Potto seems to share the leisurely mode of
  progression of its Asiatic relatives, if Bosman, its original describer,
  is to be trusted. He says: "By the negroes called Potto, but known to us
  by the name of Sluggard, doubtless from its lazy, sluggish nature; a
  whole day being little enough for it to advance ten steps forward." The
  same writer did not at all appreciate his addition to zoological
  knowledge, for he remarked that the Potto "hath nothing very particular
  but his odious ugliness." The Angwantibo is rare and but little known.
  Our knowledge of its anatomy is derived from a paper by Huxley.<a
  name="NtA_408" href="#Nt_408"><sup>[408]</sup></a> It is an animal
  measuring about 10½ inches in total length to the end of the tail, which
  is only a quarter of an inch long. The hands and feet are smaller than
  those of <i>Perodicticus</i>. The index finger is rudimentary and has but
  two phalanges, and it has no trace of a nail. In this it agrees with the
  Potto, but "the spinous processes of the cervical vertebrae do not
  project in the manner described by van der Hoeven in the Potto, though
  they can be readily felt through the skin." The dental formula of this
  genus as of the last is I&nbsp;2/2 C&nbsp;1/1 Pm&nbsp;3/3 M&nbsp;3/3. The last lower molar
  has a fifth cusp, which is wanting in the Potto. The last upper molar is
  tricuspid. It is bicuspid in the Potto. It seems impossible to avoid
  agreeing with Professor Huxley that the Angwantibo is entitled to generic
  separation.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Loris</i> also contains but a single species, <i>L.
  gracilis</i>, and is, as its name denotes, an animal of more slender
  build than the Slow Loris. Its eyes are very large, and the limbs
  excessively <!-- Page 548 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page548"></a>{548}</span>slender. The index finger is much as in
  <i>Nycticebus</i>. The colour, too, is not widely different, being of a
  yellowish grey, but it lacks the dorsal stripe which distinguishes its
  relative. The incisor teeth are equal and very small. The last upper
  molar has four cusps instead of the three of <i>Nycticebus</i>. This
  Lemur is confined to Southern India and Ceylon, and has much the same
  habits as the last. But it is rather more active, and can capture small
  birds when sleeping upon the trees; its diet, however, is mixed, and is
  vegetarian as well as animal.</p>

  <p>A mysterious Lemur, which we conveniently place as a kind of appendix
  to the present family on account of its locality, has been shortly
  described by Nachtrieb from the Philippines. The tail is rudimentary;
  there are two upper incisors, but as many as six lower. It is doubtful
  what the beast really is.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Chiromyidae.</b>&mdash;This family contains but a single
  genus and species, the Aye-aye, <i>Chiromys madagascariensis</i>, whose
  characters therefore are for the present those of the family as well as
  of the genus and species. The external features of this extraordinary
  animal will be gathered from an inspection of Fig. 263, from which it
  will be seen that the earlier name of <i>Sciurus</i> given to the
  creature was not by any means a misnomer. The Squirrel-like appearance is
  due, of course, chiefly to the strong and long incisor teeth. As to the
  external characters, which are of systematic importance, <!-- Page 549
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page549"></a>{549}</span>attention may
  be called to the long and bushy tail, to the greater length of the
  hind-limbs, to the abdominal teats (one pair) in the female, and above
  all to the singular third digit of the hand, which is thin and elongated.
  The thumb is, as in other Lemurs, opposable, and has a flat nail; the
  remaining digits have claws, as have also the toes with the exception of
  the great toe, which has a flat nail like the thumb.</p>

  <p>The anatomy of this animal has occupied the attention of a
  considerable number of observers, dating from Sir R. Owen, who was the
  first to give a connected account of its entire organisation. The most
  recent paper of importance is by Dr. Oudemans.<a name="NtA_409"
  href="#Nt_409"><sup>[409]</sup></a> The teeth are very unlike those of
  other Lemurs. The most remarkable divergence is in the incisors, which
  are present to the number of but a single pair in each jaw, and are
  shaped like those of the Rodentia, and in the same way as in that group
  grow from persistent pulps. There are likewise, as in the Rodents, no
  canines. There are two premolars in the upper jaw (none in the lower) and
  altogether twelve molars, so that there is a total of eighteen teeth. The
  intestine has a moderately long caecum. The brain has been most fully
  described by Oudemans, who had fresh material to work with, the brain
  described by Owen having been extracted from a spirit-preserved carcase.
  The angular fissure is well developed, as in Lemur and the Indri; but it
  does not join the infero-frontal. The antero-temporal fissure is also
  well developed.</p>

  <p>"The name of Aye-aye," wrote Sonnerat, the discoverer of the animal,
  "which I have retained for it, is a cry of surprise of the inhabitants of
  Madagascar." It is, however, usually said that the animal itself makes a
  sound which may be written in the same way (or with an initial H). It is
  an arboreal and nocturnal animal, which accounts for its excessive rarity
  at one time. In one of his many eloquent essays upon natural history the
  late Mr. P. H. Gosse adduced the Aye-aye as an example of a creature on
  the verge of extinction. It is, however, now more frequently met with,
  though the superstition of the natives renders its capture a matter of
  some difficulty. There is a specimen at the moment of writing in the
  Zoological Society's Gardens. There has been some discussion as to the
  use of the slender middle finger: it is stated that it can thrust it into
  the <!-- Page 550 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page550"></a>{550}</span>borings of the larva of a certain beetle
  of which the Lemur is particularly fond, and can extract the insect, or
  at any rate discover its position, when it may be extracted by the
  powerful chisel-shaped teeth. The partiality of the Aye-aye for animal
  food of any kind including insects has been both reaffirmed and denied;
  and Mr. Bartlett has seen the creature use its slender finger for combing
  out its hair, and for other purposes of the "toilet." Dr. Oudemans has
  figured in his paper an apple which has been largely eaten by the
  <i>Chiromys</i>; the fleshy pulp has been entirely excavated, leaving
  only the core and the skin, which are untouched. The Rev. Mr. Baron is
  one of the latest writers upon the ways of life of <i>Chiromys</i>.<a
  name="NtA_410" href="#Nt_410"><sup>[410]</sup></a> He states that it
  inhabits the most dense parts of the forests. It has the habit of
  prowling about in pairs, and the female produces but a single young one
  at a birth. A nest, which is about 2 feet across, is made of twigs in
  lofty branches. This is occupied during the day, and entered by a hole in
  the side. With regard to the superstitious veneration in which the animal
  is held, it is said that if a person sleeps in the forest the Aye-aye
  will bring him a pillow. "If a pillow for the head, the person will
  become rich; if for the feet, he will shortly succumb to the creature's
  fatal power, or at least will become bewitched." But a counter-charm may
  be obtained. It is said that the reverence for this beast leads the
  natives to bury carefully a specimen found dead.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Tarsiidae.</b>&mdash;This family also consists of but a
  single genus, <i>Tarsius</i>, to which it is the general opinion that but
  a single species belongs; there are, however, at least four different
  specific names on record. The general aspect of the animal is not unlike
  that of a Galago, with which it also agrees in the elongation of the
  ankle; but the elongation is more pronounced in the present genus. The
  ears are large, and the eyes are extraordinarily developed. The fingers
  and toes terminate in large expanded discs, and are furnished with
  flattened nails except on the second and third toes, which have claws.
  The tail is longer than the body and is tufted at the end. The skull is
  more like that of the Anthropoidea than is the skull of any other Lemur.
  The resemblance is by reason of the almost complete separation of the
  orbit and the temporal fossa by bone; <!-- Page 551 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page551"></a>{551}</span>there is, however, a
  gap left to mark the Lemurine characters of the animal. The placenta,
  too, has been compared to that of the Apes. The dental formula is that of
  the genus <i>Lemur</i>, save for the absence of an incisor on each side
  of the lower jaw; the number of teeth is therefore thirty-four. The
  incisors of the lower jaw are upright, and not procumbent as in other
  Lemurs. The caecum is of moderate length. The brain is almost smooth, but
  there is a Sylvian fissure and an antero-temporal, which latter does not
  reach the lower margin of the brain, but divides the middle part of the
  temporal lobe. The name Tarsier, as may be inferred, was originally given
  to this creature by Buffon on account of the abnormal ankle, and it was
  compared by him with the Jerboa, like which animal the Tarsier leaps when
  it descends to the ground. The genus is Malayan, but its range extends to
  the Philippines and to Celebes and Borneo. The Tarsiers are nocturnal and
  particularly arboreal; they live in pairs, in holes in tree stems, and
  are mainly insectivorous in their food. One, rarely two young are
  produced at a birth. Contrary to what is found in many Lemurs, the
  Tarsier is a silent creature, and at most emits a "sharp, shrill call."
  Dr. Charles Hose, who has studied this creature, has noticed that the
  mother often carries her young one about in her mouth like a Cat. Like so
  many Lemurs this animal is held in superstitious dread, which no doubt is
  the result of its most weird appearance.<a name="NtA_411"

  <p><b>Fossil Lemurs.</b>&mdash;The Lemuroids are a very ancient race;
  they extend back to the very earliest strata of the Eocene, the Torrejon
  and Puerco beds, which, as already said, are thought to be more referable
  to the Cretaceous than to the Tertiary epoch. <!-- Page 552 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page552"></a>{552}</span>One of these early
  forms is referred to the genus <i>Mixodectes</i>, a genus which has been
  placed, though with a query, in the order Rodentia. It appears, however,
  to be a Lemuroid, and is of American range. The incisor teeth have been
  held to argue that it lies on the direct track of <i>Chiromys</i>; but
  other features, more especially the form of the astragalus, have been
  used to argue the justice of the inclusion of this type within the order
  Rodentia. Allied, as it is supposed, to this form is <i>Indrodon</i>,
  also of the lowest Eocene deposits of the United States. <i>Indrodon
  malaris</i> is known from fragments of nearly all parts of the skeleton.
  They indicate the existence of a creature of about one-half the size of
  <i>Lemur varius</i>. It had slender limbs and a long and powerful tail.
  The humerus, as in so many archaic beasts, has an entepicondylar foramen.
  The femur has three trochanters, and the fibula articulates with the
  astragalus. It is not always easy to distinguish these primitive mammals
  from each other, so that the minutest of characters have to be called in
  to our assistance. One of the contemporaneous groups with which these
  early Lemurs might be confused is that of the Condylarthra; it is
  important, therefore, to note that in <i>Indrodon</i> the
  calcaneo-cuboidal articulation is nearly flat, and not bent as it is in
  the former group. The teeth are of the tritubercular pattern. The
  incisors are not known, but the molars and premolars are each three. To
  the same family, which has been termed <b>Anaptomorphidae</b>, is
  referred the genus <i>Anaptomorphus</i>, which has been specially
  compared to <i>Tarsius</i>. This small animal has a Lemurine face with
  huge orbits. It has a premolar less than <i>Indrodon</i>. It has been
  ascertained that <i>A. homunculus</i> had an external lachrymal
  foramen.<a name="NtA_412" href="#Nt_412"><sup>[412]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Another family, that of the <b>Chriacidae</b>, appear to hover on the
  border line of Lemurs and Creodonts, having been referred to both by
  various palaeontologists. Professor Scott suggests their Lemurine or at
  least Primate relationships, while Cope urged their Creodont affinities.
  A difficulty raised by Scott was, that in <i>Chriacus</i> the premolars
  of the lower jaw were spaced. But it appears that this is not fatal to
  their inclusion in the Primates, since <i>Tomitherium</i>, an "undoubted
  Primate," shows the same feature. If <i>Chriacus</i> is a Lemur it is an
  earlier type than those <!-- Page 553 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page553"></a>{553}</span>which have been considered; for it has the
  typical Eutherian dentition of four premolars and three molars. These
  teeth, especially the superior molars, are particularly compared to the
  corresponding teeth of <i>Lemur</i> and <i>Galago</i>. Of this and the
  allied genus, <i>Protochriacus</i>, several species are known.</p>

  <p><i>Adapis</i>, a representative of another family, is one of the best
  known of ancient Lemuroids. It has the typical mammalian dentition of
  forty-four teeth in a close series without diastemata. The orbits are
  completely separated from the temporal cavity, the eyes looking forwards.
  The canines are large and caniniform. The skull is deeply ridged behind
  with the usual sagittal crest. This genus is European, and corresponds to
  the already mentioned American Eocene <i>Tomitherium</i>, perhaps
  belonging to the same family.</p>

  <p><i>Nesopithecus</i> is an extinct genus from Madagascar, lately
  described by Dr. Forsyth Major.<a name="NtA_413"
  href="#Nt_413"><sup>[413]</sup></a> There are two species, <i>N.
  roberti</i> and <i>N. australis</i>. The dental formula is I&nbsp;2, C&nbsp;1,
  Pm&nbsp;3, M&nbsp;3, for the upper jaw, the lower jaw having but a single pair of
  incisors. The lachrymal foramen is just inside, or on the edge, of the
  orbit, so that one distinctive Lemurine character is lost. The genus is
  also Ape-like in the form of the canines and incisors, these having been
  especially compared by Dr. Forsyth Major with those of the
  Cercopithecidae. The molars, too, agree with those of the same family.
  There is, however, one important feature in which <i>Nesopithecus</i>
  resembles not only the Lemurs as opposed to the Apes, but the Malagasy
  Lemurs. As already mentioned (p. <a href="#page544">544</a>), Dr. Major
  has shown that in the Malagasy Lemurs, even including the aberrant
  <i>Chiromys</i>, and in the Tertiary and European <i>Adapis</i>, the
  bulla tympani is not produced by an ossified extension of the annulus
  tympanicus, but from the adjacent periotic bone, the annulus remaining
  separate and lying within the fully-formed bulla. This feature shows
  conclusively that <i>Adapis</i> is a Lemur, and that <i>Nesopithecus</i>,
  originally supposed to be a Monkey, cannot be removed from the
  Lemuroidea, many though its likenesses to the higher Primates undoubtedly
  are. However, this feature, combined with the fact that the orbital and
  temporal cavities are in communication, shows the Lemuroid position of
  <i>Nesopithecus</i>, though it is quite conceivable that it is on the way
  to become an Ape. <!-- Page 554 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page554"></a>{554}</span></p>

  <p>A family, <b>Megaladapididae</b>, has been quite lately founded by Dr.
  Forsyth Major<a name="NtA_414" href="#Nt_414"><sup>[414]</sup></a> to
  include the remains of a gigantic extinct Lemur from Madagascar, which
  when alive, so far as we can judge from the skull, must have been three
  or four times the size of the Common Cat. The name <i>Megaladapis
  madagascariensis</i> was given to the fossil on account of certain
  resemblances to the also extinct <i>Adapis</i>. It differs from other
  Lemurs in a number of characters which jointly warrant its inclusion in a
  distinct family. The small size of the orbits suggest a diurnal life; the
  deep mandibles, which, unlike what is found in other Lemurs, are
  completely blended at the suture, point to the existence of a howling
  apparatus, as in <i>Mycetes</i>. The low brain-case is a character which
  is found in so many extinct Mammalia belonging to many different orders
  that it weighs neither one way nor the other in considering the
  systematic position of the animal. The shape of the molars, which are
  three in each half of each jaw as in other Lemurs, is, according to the
  discoverer, like that of the genus <i>Lepilemur</i>. The incisors and the
  canines are not known. Of a still larger form, <i>M. insignis</i>, the
  molar teeth are known.<a name="NtA_415"
  href="#Nt_415"><sup>[415]</sup></a></p>

<h5><span class="sc">Sub-Order 2.</span> ANTHROPOIDEA.</h5>

  <p>The Apes differ from the Lemurs in that the teats are always
  restricted to the thoracic region; the orbit, though surrounded by bone
  as in the Lemurs (and in <i>Tupaia</i>, a very Lemur-like Insectivore),
  does not open freely behind into the temporal fossa as in Lemurs (except
  <i>Tarsius</i>). The lachrymal opening is inside the orbit instead of
  outside; the cerebral hemispheres are more highly developed, and conceal,
  or nearly conceal, the cerebellum; the upper incisors are in close
  contact; a few other points are mentioned under the description of the
  characters of the Lemurs. There are altogether about 212 species of
  Monkeys and Apes. They are tropical and subtropical in range, and, with
  but few exceptions, are impatient of cold.</p>

  <p>The Monkeys are primarily divisible into two great divisions, which
  have been termed, on account of the characters of the nose, <!-- Page 555
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page555"></a>{555}</span>the
  Catarrhines and Platyrrhines. In the former the nostrils look downward
  and are close together; in the latter they are separated by a broad
  cartilaginous septum, and the apertures are directed outwards. But
  numerous other points of difference separate these two groups of the
  Monkey tribe. The Catarrhines often have those remarkable ischial
  callosities, patches of hard skin brightly coloured; the tail may be
  totally wanting as a distinct organ, as is the case, for instance, with
  the Anthropoid Apes; there are often cheek pouches, so that, as Mr.
  Lydekker has remarked, if a Monkey be observed to stow nuts away in its
  cheeks for future reference, we may be certain that its home is in the
  Old World, for the Catarrhines are exclusively denizens of the Old World,
  while the Platyrrhines are as exclusively New World in range. Again,
  those of the Catarrhines which do possess a long tail, such as the
  members of the genus <i>Cercocebus</i>, never show the least sign of
  prehensility in that tail. The teeth of the Catarrhines are invariably
  thirty-two in number, the formula being I&nbsp;2/2 C&nbsp;1/1 Pm&nbsp;2/2 M&nbsp;3/3 =
  32.</p>

  <p>In the Old-World Apes there is a bony external auditory meatus, which
  is wanting (as a bony structure) in the Platyrrhines. The late Mr. W. A.
  Forbes pointed out that in most of the New-World forms the parietals and
  the malars come into contact; in the Monkeys of the Old World they are
  hindered from coming into contact by the frontals and the alisphenoids.
  The Platyrrhines may have the same number of teeth; this is the case with
  the Marmosets, but in them there are three premolars and two molars; in
  the remaining New-World Monkeys there are thirty-six teeth, but of these
  three are premolars and three molars.</p>

  <p>Not only are these two groups of the Primates absolutely distinct at
  the present day, but they have been, so far as we know, for a very long
  time, since no fossil remains of Monkeys at all intermediate have been so
  far discovered. This has led to the suggestion that the Monkeys are what
  is termed diphyletic, <i>i.e.</i> that they have originated from two
  separate stocks of ancestors. It is hard, however, to understand on this
  view the very great similarities which underlie the divergences that have
  just been mentioned. But, on the other hand, it is equally hard to
  understand how it is that, having been separated from each other for so
  long a period, they have not diverged further in <!-- Page 556 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page556"></a>{556}</span>structure than they
  have. The Platyrrhines seem to stand at the base of the series. This is
  another example of the existence of archaic creatures in South
  America.</p>

<h5><span class="sc">Group I.</span> <i>PLATYRRHINA.</i></h5>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Hapalidae.</b>&mdash;We may begin the account of the
  Platyrrhine Monkeys with the Hapalidae or Marmosets; for this family is
  structurally lower than the rest. They have thirty-two teeth, arranged as
  in the following formula: I&nbsp;2/2 C&nbsp;1/1 Pm&nbsp;3/3 M&nbsp;2/2 = 32. The molars have
  three main tubercles, and not four as in the higher forms. The digits are
  for the most part clawed, not nailed, as in the higher types; the great
  toe alone bears a flat nail. The tail, too, is ringed, a condition which
  is characteristic of many of the lower groups of mammals, but not of the
  higher Apes. The cerebral hemispheres are smooth, but this is a matter
  rather connected with their small size than with low zoological position.
  The tails of the Marmosets, unlike those of so many other American
  Monkeys, are not prehensile though they are long.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Hapale</i> is broadly distinguished from the other genus,
  <i>Midas</i>, by the fact that the lower incisors slant forwards as in
  the Lemurs. They are small, soft-furred, long-tailed Monkeys, familiar to
  every one. There are some seven species, which are entirely restricted in
  range to Brazil, Bolivia, and Colombia, one species only, <i>H.
  pygmaea</i>, extending northward into Mexico.</p>

  <p>Of Tamarins, genus <i>Midas</i>, there are rather more
  species&mdash;about fourteen. They are South and Central American in
  distribution. Since both these genera are arboreal in habit, it is
  extraordinary that they have not the prehensile tails of their American
  allies. As, however, the late Mr. Bates observed an individual of the
  species <i>M. nigricollis</i> fall head-foremost from a height of at
  least 50 feet, alight on its feet, and run off as if nothing in
  particular had occurred, it is evident that no extra prehensile powers
  are absolutely necessary. Some of the Tamarins have a long mane; this is
  well seen in <i>M. rosalia</i>, or rather in <i>M. leoninus</i>, which,
  if not identical with it, is at least very closely allied to it. The name
  is obviously derived from the character <!-- Page 557 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page557"></a>{557}</span>referred to, and the
  Monkey, originally described by the traveller von Humboldt, is said to
  have "the appearance of a diminutive lion." <i>M. bicolor</i> is an
  example of the species with no mane, but with a patch of white round the
  mouth, looking like "a ball of snow-white cotton" held in the teeth.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Cebidae.</b>&mdash;The remaining American Monkeys are
  comprised in the family Cebidae. This is to be distinguished from the
  last by the fact that there is an additional molar, thus making
  thirty-six teeth in all. The tail, sometimes very short, is more
  generally long and highly prehensile, being nude at the extremity, which
  part is therefore especially prehensile; this state of affairs is often
  to be seen in animals with prehensile tails. The Cebidae, though for the
  most part larger than the Marmosets, never approach in size the Old-World
  Apes.</p>

  <p>Typical of the family is the genus <i>Cebus</i>, including the
  "Capuchin" Monkeys, and consisting of nearly twenty species; the tail,
  though prehensile, is covered with hair to the tip, a fact which is
  indicative of a less perfect prehensility than is exhibited in some
  Monkeys with a naked under surface to the tip of the tail. The thumb is
  well developed. The genus ranges from Costa Rica to Paraguay. The
  commonest Monkey which accompanies the street organs of this country is a
  <i>Cebus</i>. It is a popular delusion that these and other monkeys are
  purely vegetable-feeding animals. <i>Cebus</i> is in fact particularly
  fond of caterpillars, as are also the Marmosets.</p>

  <p>Allied to <i>Cebus</i> is <i>Lagothrix</i>, the Woolly Monkey, of
  which <i>L. humboldti</i> is the best-known species, there being indeed
  but one other. It is a larger and heavier animal than any species of
  <i>Cebus</i>; and the Hare-like woolliness of the fur suggested its
  scientific name to its original describer, von Humboldt. It has a
  perfectly prehensile tail, naked at the tip. The thumb and great toe are
  well developed. These are purely fruit-eating Monkeys, and are known as
  "Barrigudos" by the Portuguese of the Amazon country on account of their
  prominent belly, due apparently to the immense amount of fruit consumed.
  They are, or were, much eaten by natives.</p>

  <p><i>Brachyteles</i> is a little-known genus, connecting the last with
  the next genus. The under fur is woolly; the thumb is small or absent.
  The tail is naked below.</p>

  <p>The Spider monkeys, <i>Ateles</i> or Coaitas, have been described as
  <!-- Page 558 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page558"></a>{558}</span>the most typically arboreal of American
  monkeys. The use of the prehensile tail can frequently be studied in
  living examples in the Zoological Society's Gardens. With this "fifth
  hand" the Monkey feels for a place to grasp, and securely twists its tail
  round, moving it with the greatest ease from point to point. When the
  tail is being thus used it is carried erect over the head. The fact that
  this genus possesses no functional thumb is thought to be associated with
  the extreme perfection of its adaptability to an exclusively arboreal
  life. The hand without a thumb can act as an equally efficient hook for
  suspending the body; and what is useless in nature tends to disappear.
  These Monkeys have a wide range, extending from Mexico in the north to
  Uruguay in the south. There are ten species. The flesh of many Monkeys is
  eaten not only by natives but by Europeans; but the Spider Monkeys are
  said to furnish the most sapid food of all.</p>

  <p>The Howling Monkeys, genus <i>Mycetes</i>, have also received the
  appropriate generic names of <i>Alouatta</i> and <i>Stentor</i>. The
  former of these two names, indeed, is that which should properly be
  applied to the genus. But <i>Mycetes</i> is perhaps better known. The
  "howling" is produced by saccular diverticula of the larynx, larger than
  those of other American Monkeys, such as <i>Ateles</i>, where, however,
  they are also developed. The hyoid bones, too, <!-- Page 559 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page559"></a>{559}</span>are enormously enlarged
  and cavernous, while the jaw&mdash;in order to accommodate and protect
  these various structures&mdash;is unusually large and deep. The Howlers
  are furnished with a fully prehensile tail. The thumb is present. They
  are described as being the most hideous in aspect of the American
  Monkeys, and of the lowest intelligence, with which latter characteristic
  is associated a less convoluted brain than in <i>Ateles</i>, for example.
  The noise produced by these Monkeys is audible for miles, and is said not
  to be due to emulation, <i>i.e.</i> not to be comparable to singing or
  talking, but to serve to intimidate their enemies. The story told of
  these and other Monkeys with prehensile tails, that they cross rivers by
  means of a bridge of intertwined Monkeys, is apparently devoid of truth.
  There are six species, which are Central and South American in range.</p>

  <p>The Squirrel Monkeys, genus <i>Chrysothrix</i>, are small creatures
  with a long head, the occiput projecting. Their tail, though long, has no
  naked area at the extremity and is non-prehensile. It is a remarkable
  fact that the proportions of the cranium as compared with the face are
  greater, not only than in other Monkeys, but than in Man himself. The
  thumb is short, but not so short as in the Spider Monkeys. The cerebral
  hemispheres are very smooth; but, as already remarked, this is a matter
  of size, and not of low position in the series. It may appear at first
  sight that this statement contradicts the one made concerning the
  Howlers. But the latter are large Monkeys, and therefore ought, so to
  speak, to have a more complex brain; but they have not. Like so many of
  the American Monkeys, the Squirrel Monkeys are gregarious, and, in spite
  of their tails, arboreal. They are largely insect-feeders, and also catch
  small birds and devour eggs. There are four species, of which <i>C.
  sciurea</i> is the commonest, and is constantly an inmate of the
  Zoological Society's Gardens. Humboldt asserted of it that when vexed its
  eyes filled with tears; but Darwin did not succeed in seeing this very
  human expression of an emotion.</p>

  <p><i>Callithrix</i> is a genus not far removed from the last, and, like
  it, occurs both in Central and in South America. It is chiefly to be
  distinguished from <i>Chrysothrix</i> by the non-extension backwards of
  the head, and by the more furry character of the tail. The lower jaw is
  rather deep, as in the Howlers; but there is not, or there has not been
  discovered, a howling apparatus like <!-- Page 560 --><span

  Nevertheless Professor Weldon<a name="NtA_416"
  href="#Nt_416"><sup>[416]</sup></a> has found in a female of <i>C.
  gigot</i> a patch of ossification on the thyroid cartilage of the larynx
  which may be an indication of something more in the male. There are
  eleven species.</p>

  <p><i>Nyctipithecus</i>, the Doroucouli Monkeys, is a genus of somewhat
  Lemurine appearance, caused by their large eyes. But they reminded Bates
  of an Owl or a Tiger-cat! They have a long, but not prehensile tail. As
  in the Marmosets, the lower incisors project forwards in a Lemurine
  fashion. The thumb is very short. A peculiarity of this genus is the
  twenty-two dorso-lumbar vertebrae. As in <i>Chrysothrix</i>, but not as
  in <i>Callithrix</i>, the hemispheres of the brain are smooth. There are
  five species, of which one occurs so far north as Nicaragua; the rest are
  Brazilian, extending down to the Argentine.</p>

  <p>The Ouakari Monkeys, <i>Brachyurus</i>,<a name="NtA_417"
  href="#Nt_417"><sup>[417]</sup></a> are, as the name denotes,
  short-tailed forms. Two species, <i>B. rubicundus</i> and <i>B.

  one. There is a small thumb. The brain is fairly convoluted, and is to be
  specially compared with that of <i>Cebus</i> and <i>Pithecia</i>. The

  <p>Not the least remarkable fact about these Ouakari Monkeys is their
  distribution in South America. We cannot do better than quote the summary
  given by Messrs. P. L. and W. L. Sclater in their <i>Geography of
  Mammals</i>, which is as follows: "Each of them, as first shown by Bates
  and afterwards further explained by Forbes, is limited to a comparatively
  small tract of forest on the banks of the Amazon and its affluents. The
  Black-headed Ouakari (<i>B. melanocephalus</i>) ... is met with only in a
  tract <!-- Page 562 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page562"></a>{562}</span>traversed by the Rio Negro; the
  Bald-headed Ouakari appears to be confined to the triangle formed by the
  union of the Amazon with another affluent, the Japura; and the Red
  Ouakari to the forests on the north bank of the Amazon opposite Olivença,
  and lying between the main stream and the River Iça. Each of them
  evidently takes the place of the others in its particular district. Of
  this peculiar kind of distribution few instances are known amongst
  mammals, but many somewhat similar cases have been observed in birds,
  reptiles, and insects."</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Pithecia</i>, the Sakis, consists of five species with
  long bushy tails, which are non-prehensile. They are bearded and have a
  thumb. Like the last genus, <i>Pithecia</i> does not extend into Central
  America. The incisors project forwards, and the lower jaw is deep, though
  the howling apparatus of <i>Mycetes</i> is wanting. The thin,
  closely-set, and projecting incisors are very suggestive of those of the
  Lemurs. <i>Brachyurus</i> is much like <i>Pithecia</i> in this respect,
  and both differ markedly from such a genus as <i>Cebus</i>, where the
  lower incisors are vertical. An anatomical peculiarity of <i>Pithecia</i>
  is the breadth of the ribs. <i>P. satanas</i> is perhaps the best-known
  species, but all five have been exhibited at the Zoological Society's
  Gardens. As its name suggests, <i>P. satanas</i> is entirely black; it
  shows a curious point of difference from <i>P. cheiropotes</i> in its way
  of drinking. The latter species, as its name denotes, uses its hand to
  drink, while <i>P. satanas</i> puts its mouth to the water. <i>P.
  albinasa</i> is black with a red patch on the nose, within which again is
  a small white patch.</p>

<h5><span class="sc">Group II.</span> <i>CATARRHINA.</i></h5>

  <p>The Catarrhine Apes are divisible into three or perhaps only two
  families, the Cercopithecidae and the Simiidae, to which must be added
  the Hominidae. The Simiidae are sometimes spoken of as the Anthropoid
  Apes.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Cercopithecidae.</b>&mdash;Of the Cercopithecidae there are
  eight genera (perhaps nine) to be recognised, which may be distributed
  into two sub-families. The first of these two sub-families, that of the
  <b>Cercopithecinae</b>, has the following characters<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span>There are cheek pouches in which the animals
  store food temporarily. <!-- Page 563 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page563"></a>{563}</span>The stomach is simple and globular; this
  corresponds with a mixed diet. The tail is long or short, or practically
  absent.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:46%;">
      <a href="images/268.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/268.png"

<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 268.&mdash;Tcheli Monkey. <i>Macacus tcheliensis.</i> × <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">6</span>. (From <i>Nature</i>.)</p>

  <p>The most familiar genus is undoubtedly <i>Macacus</i>. This includes
  all the common so-called Macaques, the Bonnet Monkey, the Pig-tailed
  Monkey, etc. In this genus we find that the males are larger than the
  females, and have stronger canine teeth. Ischial callosities are well
  developed. The genus is purely Asiatic, reaching as far east as Japan,
  with the exception of the Barbary Ape, <i>M. inuus</i>, also known as the
  Gibraltar Ape. There are altogether some seventeen species.</p>

  <p><i>Macacus inuus</i> is doubtfully indigenous to Gibraltar. It is,
  however, definitely established there at present, and is carefully
  fostered. It is a large Ape with no external tail, in which <!-- Page 564
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page564"></a>{564}</span>particular it
  is unique among the members of its genus. At one time its extinction on
  the "Rock" was nearly accomplished, but three individuals being known. In
  1893 the Governor of Gibraltar informed Mr. Sclater that he had himself
  counted as many as thirty in one herd. Its depredations seem to have led
  to the expression of a wish in some quarters that the numbers should be
  thinned; but feeling on the opposite side appears to be stronger, so that
  whatever was the actual mode of its introduction on to the "Rock" it will
  at any rate remain there unmolested for the present.</p>

  <p><i>M. tcheliensis</i> is a species found in the Yung-ling Mountains in
  North China. It is, with the possible exception of <i>M. speciosus</i>,
  the most northerly form of Monkey. It is interesting on account of the
  fact that like the Tiger of those regions it has put on an extra coating
  of fur to enable it to combat with the bitter winters. It is doubtful
  whether it is more than a variety of the Rhesus Monkey (<i>M.
  rhesus</i>).</p>

  <p><i>M. nemestrinus</i>, "the Pig-tailed Macaque," is trained by the
  natives of the east to climb cocoa-nut palms and to carefully select and
  throw down only the ripe fruit. Sir Stamford Raffles apparently was the
  first to report upon this useful intelligence of the animal, and Dr.
  Charles Hose of Borneo has confirmed him.</p>

  <p>The Japanese Macaque (<i>M. speciosus</i>) is well known from the work
  of Japanese artists. It is the only species of Monkey found in Japan, and
  goes very far north.</p>

  <p>A rather rare form is <i>M. leoninus</i>. It has a short tail, and
  occurs in Burmah. <i>M. silenus</i> is distinguished by a ruff of long
  light-coloured hair surrounding the face. It is sometimes called the
  Wanderoo; but this is apparently quite inaccurate, since that term is
  used by the Ceylonese for a <i>Semnopithecus</i>. For those who wish a
  "pseudo-vernacular" name Dr. Blanford suggests Pennant's name of
  "Lion-tailed Monkey."</p>

  <p>The commonest species of the genus are <i>M. cynomolgus</i>, <i>M.
  sinicus</i>, and <i>M. rhesus</i>.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Cercocebus</i>, including those Monkeys known as
  Mangabeys, is confined to West Africa. They have always a long tail,
  quite as long as the body. The upper eyelids are pure white in colour.
  The ischial callosities are more pronounced than in the Macaques. In the
  Mangabeys also the hairs are not ringed with differently coloured bars,
  as is the case with both <!-- Page 565 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page565"></a>{565}</span>Macaques and <i>Cercopithecus</i>, giving
  to them the greenish hue which characterises so many of the last two
  genera. There are no laryngeal air sacs as in the Macaques. There are not
  more than seven species.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Cercopithecus</i> (the Guenons) represents in Africa the
  Oriental and Palaearctic Macaques; the genus has a long tail. The cheek
  pouches are larger than in the genus <i>Macacus</i>. The ischial
  callosities are less extensive than in that genus. A tooth character also
  distinguishes this genus from <i>Macacus</i>; the last molar of the lower
  jaw has, as a very general rule, only four cusps instead of the five
  which are found in <i>Macacus</i>. The supraciliary ridges in the skull
  are by no means so marked as in the allied genera.</p>

  <p>One species, the Talapoin, <i>C. talapoin</i>, has been separated into
  a distinct genus, <i>Miopithecus</i>, on account of the fact that the
  lower molars have only three tubercles instead of the usual four. But if
  this be done, then <i>Cercopithecus moloneyi</i>, which has a lower molar
  with five tubercles, should also be separated.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Cercopithecus</i> is limited to Africa, and its numerous
  species have often a very limited range. They are frequently rather
  brightly coloured, with blue and white patches on the face. The Diana
  Monkey has a pointed white beard. Of the Vervet Monkey (<i>C.
  lalandii</i>) a curious fact was noticed at the Zoological <!-- Page 566
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page566"></a>{566}</span>Society's
  Gardens a year or two back: the young was observed to take both teats of
  the mother into its mouth at once. Mr. Sclater<a name="NtA_418"
  href="#Nt_418"><sup>[418]</sup></a> in a recent list of the group allows
  forty-seven species, of which thirty-three were examined by himself.
  Subsequently, however, the list has been reduced to forty by the same
  authority. One of the rarest species is <i>C. stairsi</i>, first
  described from a skin stripped from a specimen which lived for a short
  time at the Zoological Gardens.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Cynocephalus</i> (or <i>Papio</i>) includes the Baboons;
  and the scientific name indicates the Dog-like aspect of these animals,
  due to the projecting snout. <i>Cynocephalus</i> is confined to Africa
  and Arabia. Several of the species of the genus are well known. The
  Mandrill, <i>C. mormon</i> (or <i>maimon</i>), has blue ridges on the
  muzzle, the bridge of the nose being red. The animal lives in herds, and
  is ferocious and omnivorous. The Chacma Baboon, <i>C. porcarius</i>, is
  the largest of Baboons. It lives in South Africa in large herds. The
  Arabian Baboon, <i>C. hamadryas</i>, is the Sacred Baboon of the
  Egyptians. The names of two other species, <i>C. thoth</i> and <i>C.
  anubis</i>, serve also to remind us of the ancient Egyptians. There are
  altogether eleven species of <i>Cynocephalus</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Gelada</i> (or <i>Theropithecus</i>) is separated as a distinct
  genus. Though regarded as a Baboon, Garrod has pointed out many points of
  likeness to <i>Cercopithecus</i>.<a name="NtA_419"
  href="#Nt_419"><sup>[419]</sup></a> The two species are, like the other
  Baboons, African.</p>

  <p><i>Cynopithecus niger</i> is a small black Baboon from Celebes. It has
  swellings on the muzzle as in other Baboons, but differs from them in
  being a more amiable creature as well as in its smaller size. It has a
  rudimentary tail, smaller even than the small tail of the typical
  Baboons. It has, like them, ischial callosities.</p>

  <p>In the second sub-family, <b>Semnopithecinae</b>, the following
  characters are distinctive<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span>All the Apes of
  this group are slender in form, with a long tail. There are no cheek
  pouches. The stomach is sacculated; it is divided into three portions.
  This is accompanied by an apparently more exclusively vegetarian diet
  than characterises other Apes, which mingle with their diet of fruit a
  large proportion of insects, eggs, etc. <!-- Page 567 --><span

  <p>The first with which we shall deal is <i>Colobus</i>, containing the
  Monkeys known as Guerezas. These creatures are entirely confined to the
  African continent, and they are arboreal in habit. It has been attempted
  to show that their affinities are more with the Platyrrhines than with
  the group in which they are really to be placed. In favour of regarding
  them as nearer akin to the American monkeys are only two facts of
  importance: the first is the practical absence of the thumb, which of
  course recalls the condition characteristic of <i>Ateles</i>; in the
  second place, the nostrils in their wideness somewhat resemble those of
  the Platyrrhines. They are slender Monkeys with well-marked callosities.
  They have a complex sacculated stomach, resembling the large intestine of
  some other animals; it is not divided into distinct chambers like the
  stomach of a Ruminant or of a Whale. Correlated apparently with this
  large stomach is the small development of the cheek pouches. This genus,
  of which there are about ten species, is characterised by beautiful
  skins, which are largely collected. The Arabs have a legend to the effect
  that one species, when wounded, and seeing its capture and the removal of
  its skin <!-- Page 568 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page568"></a>{568}</span>inevitable, carefully tears the latter,
  that its captors may not profit by it. The species of this genus are most
  abundant on the west coast of Africa. It is interesting that one species,
  <i>C. kirki</i>, is limited to the Island of Zanzibar, where, however, it
  is nearly extinct.</p>

  <p>The "Holy Apes," or Langurs, genus <i>Semnopithecus</i>, are allied to
  the last, but they are Asiatic in range. The thumb is better developed,
  but still shorter than in other Cercopithecidae; the callosities are
  small, and the cheek pouches are absent. There is a single large
  laryngeal sac, and the stomach is complex.</p>

  <p>This genus is, like the Tiger, often quoted as an example of a race
  supposed to be characteristically tropical, existing habitually in the
  coldest climate. A species of <i>Semnopithecus</i> has been observed
  climbing snow-laden branches at a height of 11,000 feet in the Himalayas.
  There are some thirty species, which extend as far east as Borneo.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:41%;">
      <a href="images/271.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/271.jpg"

<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 271.&mdash;Entellus Monkey or Hanuman. <i>Semnopithecus entellus.</i> × <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">6</span>.</p>

  <p>The name <i>Semnopithecus</i> is derived from the fact that the
  Hanuman is regarded as sacred by the Hindus. The best-known species of
  <i>Semnopithecus</i> is this Langur or Hanuman, <i>S. entellus</i>. Being
  regarded as a sacred animal, and with the advantage thus gained, it has
  become a fell nuisance in gardens and to crops. Though the veneration
  with which the Hindoos regard these animals will not allow them to slay
  them, they are exceedingly thankful to a European who will enable them to
  <!-- Page 569 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page569"></a>{569}</span>commit a sin vicariously. This Ape has
  immense powers of leaping&mdash;a space of 20 to 30 feet can be cleared
  by them if one side, that from which the leap is taken, be considerably
  higher than the other. They are useful to the Tiger hunter, as they
  follow and hoot at this, their deadly enemy. <i>S. schistaceus</i> is a
  species which lives at great heights, not less than 5000 feet, in the
  Himalayas.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Nasalis</i> is hardly separable from the genus
  <i>Semnopithecus</i>. It is a Bornean animal, and is distinguished by a
  comical long nose, which not only suggests, but goes beyond, the aquiline
  nose of the human species. It is no doubt on this account that the
  Borneans, unconsciously imitating our habit of comparing "natives" in
  general to Monkeys, call it by a name which signifies "white man."
  <i>Rhinopithecus</i> has also a long, but a more definitely upturned
  nose.</p>

  <p><b>Fossil Monkeys.</b>&mdash;Several of the existing genera of
  Old-World Apes are also known to have existed in past times; in some
  cases their past distribution indicates a greater range. Thus
  <i>Macacus</i> is now represented&mdash;and that doubtfully&mdash;in
  Europe by the Barbary Ape alone. But from Montpellier have been unearthed
  the remains of <i>M. priscus</i>, from Pliocene beds. The Asiatic
  <i>Semnopithecus</i> is known to have lived during the Pliocene period;
  its remains are discovered in France and Italy, as well as in Asia. In
  addition to these existing forms, a number of totally extinct Old-World
  genera are known. The rich formation at Pikermi near Athens has produced
  <i>Mesopithecus pentelici</i>; this Monkey has a skull which recalls that
  of <i>Semnopithecus</i>, while the stout limbs are rather Macaque-like.
  As is the case with many living Catarrhines, the males have stronger
  canines. The animal had a long tail.</p>

  <p>An analogous annectent character is shown by the Italian fossil,
  <i>Oreopithecus bambolii</i>. This animal was referred by one
  palaeontologist to the Man-like Apes, by another to the Cercopithecidae.
  It suggests a common ancestral form, and is Middle Miocene in
  horizon.</p>

  <p>Just as there are no Platyrrhine Apes in the Old World so there are no
  Catarrhines met with in a fossil condition in the New World; the two
  great divisions of the Apes were as distinct in the past, so far as we
  know, as they are now&mdash;a strong argument in favour of those who
  would derive them from two sources. The <!-- Page 570 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page570"></a>{570}</span>existing genera,
  <i>Cebus</i>, <i>Mycetes</i>, and <i>Callithrix</i>, now living in South
  America, are also known in a fossil state. The extinct genus
  <i>Homunculus</i> is known from the Tertiary strata of Patagonia, and an
  apparently allied form is <i>Anthropops</i>. These creatures, however,
  are at present far from exhaustively known.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Simiidae.</b>&mdash;The Anthropoid, or Man-like Apes,<a
  name="NtA_420" href="#Nt_420"><sup>[420]</sup></a> may be separated from
  the lower Apes as a group, Simiae, or perhaps better, on account of the
  after all slender points of difference, a family Simiidae, which has the
  following distinctive characters.</p>

  <p>Though arboreal creatures for the most part, these Apes, when they
  come to the ground, progress in at least a semi-erect fashion. Moreover,
  when they, as is usually the case, put their hands upon the ground to aid
  in walking, they do not rest as do the lower Apes upon the flat of the
  hand, but upon the back of the fingers. None of the Anthropoids has a
  tail, or cheek pouches. Ischial callosities are only seen in the Gibbons.
  There is commonly a laryngeal pouch, which is of large size, and aids in
  the production of the generally loud voice of these creatures. The hair
  is rather more scanty than in the Cercopithecidae, which is an approach
  to Man. The placenta differs in detail from that of the lower Apes, and
  is exactly like that of Man. These Apes show as further differences from
  the underlying Cercopithecidae, the greater length of the arms as
  compared with the legs, and the presence of a vermiform appendix to the
  caecum. In the latter but not the former character they agree with Man,
  whom we shall place in a separate family, Hominidae. The Anthropoid Apes
  are entirely Old World and intratropical in range at the present
  time.</p>

  <p>The Gibbons, genus <i>Hylobates</i>, stand quite at the base of the
  series of existing Anthropoid Apes. They are the smallest and the most
  purely tree-frequenting of all the members of that group. Connected with
  this habit is the structural peculiarity that their arms are
  proportionately longer than in the other Anthropoids. The affinity of the
  Gibbons to the Catarrhines is proved by the presence of distinct but
  small ischial callosities. The arms are so long that when walking upright
  the hands reach the ground. The hallux is well developed. The ribs are
  thirteen pairs. In the skull the chief noteworthy character as <!-- Page
  571 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page571"></a>{571}</span>compared
  with other Anthropoids is the fact of the large size of the canines,
  which are of equal or nearly equal size in the two sexes. The molars on
  the other hand have been particularly compared to those of Man. The brain
  is simpler than in the higher forms. But it is not clear that this may
  not be a case of diminished complexity of convolution going hand in hand
  with smallness of size.</p>

  <p>The Gibbons range through south-eastern Asia from Assam and Burmah to
  Hainan. The number of species is a little doubtful. It is clear that in
  the first place we may distinguish the Siamang, <i>H. syndactylus</i>,
  which indeed some regard as a separate genus. It is mainly to be defined
  by the syndactylous character of the second and third toes; they are
  united by skin as far as the last joint. The Hainan species, <i>H.
  hainanus</i>, is probably distinct, and the following names have been
  given to various other species or races, viz. <i>H. agilis</i>, <i>H.
  leuciscus</i>, <i>H. leucogenys</i>, <i>H. lar</i>, <i>H. hoolock</i>.
  These animals can walk erect; and when they do so, the big toe is
  separated as in unsophisticated or at least unbooted man. The voice is
  well known to be loud, <!-- Page 572 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page572"></a>{572}</span>and it is a curious fact that the Siamang,
  which has a large laryngeal pouch, is not excelled in this respect by
  species in which this sac is not developed.</p>

  <p>Of Gorillas, genus <i>Gorilla</i>, there is but one species, which
  must apparently and rather unfortunately be called <i>Gorilla

  <p>The misfortune is double: in the first place the repetition of the
  same word as both generic and specific appellation is tiresome to the
  ears and barbarous in its suggestion; in the second place it is now well
  known that the "Gorilla" of Hanno, observed by that Carthaginian voyager
  on an island off the African coast, was not a Gorilla at all as the word
  is now understood, but probably a Baboon. The external aspect of this
  great Anthropoid is familiar from many reproductions. The male, as is
  usual, is larger than the female, and his characters are more
  pronounced.</p>

  <p>The face is naked and black, and the skin generally is deep black,
  even at birth. The ear is comparatively small, and is adpressed to the
  side of the head; it is altogether more human in form than that of the
  Chimpanzee, and this statement applies also to the rudimentary condition
  of the muscles of the ear, which are more rudimentary than in the
  Chimpanzee. The nose has an obvious median ridge, and is thus pronounced
  as an external feature; the nostrils are very wide. The hands and feet
  are short, thick, and broad; the digits are webbed. In the foot the heel
  is more apparent than in other Anthropoids. It is not, <!-- Page 573
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page573"></a>{573}</span>however, so
  marked as in Man, and the phrase "Ex pede Herculem" has been aptly
  supplemented by "Ex calce hominem." The hair upon the head forms a kind
  of crest, which can be elevated when the animal is enraged. The neck is
  thick and short, and the beast has massive shoulders and a broad
  chest.</p>

  <p>If it were not for the fewness of the Anthropoid Apes, and their
  nearness to Man, it is doubtful whether the Gorilla would be ranked as a
  distinct genus,<a name="NtA_421" href="#Nt_421"><sup>[421]</sup></a> for
  in internal structure it is very near the Chimpanzee. The microscopic
  character of the investigations into the anatomy of Man have somewhat
  dimmed the proper sense of perspective, and have tended to throw into
  greater prominence than seems necessary the divergences of structure seen
  in the Gorilla. Dr. Keith<a name="NtA_422"
  href="#Nt_422"><sup>[422]</sup></a> has recently summed up and commented
  upon these divergences, and the following account of this Anthropoid is
  mainly deduced from his memoir.</p>

  <p>The cranial capacity of the Gorilla is greater than that of the
  Chimpanzee. It is not possible, however, to decide from this point of
  view whether a given skull is that of one or of the other of these Apes.
  Some Chimpanzees are higher in capacity <!-- Page 574 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page574"></a>{574}</span>than some Gorillas. But
  the average is undoubtedly as stated. It is to be noted that there is a
  correspondence between cranial capacity and size of palate, the
  correspondence being converse, <i>i.e.</i> the greater the brain the
  smaller the palate. This applies to Man as compared with his Ape-like
  relatives, but does not apply so accurately to the Gorilla, which has a
  more extensive palate than the Chimpanzee; its "brute development" is
  much greater than that of the Chimpanzee. Not only is the palate larger,
  but the molar teeth, slightly different in form, are also larger and
  stronger. This is so plainly marked that "one may say almost with
  certainty, that any upper molar tooth over 12 mm. in length is that of a
  Gorilla, and under 12 mm. is that of a Chimpanzee." In the skeleton
  generally it may be said that the crests for muscular attachments upon
  the bones are greater in the Gorilla. The nasal bones are more like those
  of lower Apes in their length, and they have a sharp ridge more marked
  than in the Chimpanzee, which, however, disappears in aged animals. It is
  a curious fact that Gorillas often have a "cleft palate," owing to the
  failure of the palatal part of the palatine bones to meet completely. The
  general conformation of the skull is less brachycephalic in the
  Gorilla.</p>

  <p>The limbs show a number of small differences, which are associated
  with a more completely arboreal life in the Chimpanzee as compared with
  the Gorilla. The latter is approaching the human way of life. In spite,
  however, of these differences, no hard and fast lines of divergence can
  be laid down between the two African Anthropoids, for it appears from the
  many memoirs that have been written upon both that "there is scarcely a
  feature in any muscle or bone found in one animal which is not also found
  in the other." The heel of the Gorilla has already been referred to. This
  is, of course, associated with a plantigrade and therefore non-arboreal
  mode of progression. Certain of the muscles of the calf of the leg
  attached to the heel show a more human arrangement in the Gorilla than in
  the Chimpanzee. It is interesting to find that the muscles of the little
  toe are diminishing in the Gorilla as in Man. This is most clearly due to
  terrestrial progression and we may apply the same explanation to Man and
  ignore tight boots! The arm of the Gorilla is less adapted to arboreal
  progression. Its proportions differ from those of the arm of the
  Chimpanzee in that the fore-arm is shorter. In <!-- Page 575 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page575"></a>{575}</span>both animals the thumb
  is not of much use, and this digit is more retrograde in the Gorilla, not
  only in proportionate length but in its muscular supply. The hip girdle
  tells the same tale. It is broader in the Gorilla, and the glutaei
  muscles are more prominent, all these features being connected with the
  more erect gait.</p>

  <p>The brain of both animals have been studied, but not in the case of
  the Gorilla from a sufficiently large number of examples to make any
  generalisations of great value. On the whole, the Gorilla has the larger
  brain, but this must be discounted by the fact that it also has the
  larger body. It is a remarkable fact that the Gorilla's liver is much
  more like that of lower Apes than the liver of other Anthropoids. It has,
  as has the Chimpanzee, laryngeal sacs. The general conclusion concerning
  the relative position of the two African Anthropoids seems to be that the
  Gorilla is the more primitive; and as thus it must approach more nearly
  to the original parent than does the Chimpanzee, it may be said that it
  also comes rather nearer to Man, since the Chimpanzee has travelled away
  from the common stock on another line. The detailed likenesses to Man,
  however, are not to be unduly dwelt upon; for they mainly come from a
  tendency to assume the plantigrade mode of progression.</p>

  <p>In mental characteristics there is the widest difference between the
  two Apes that we are considering. The Chimpanzee is lively, and&mdash;at
  least when young&mdash;teachable and tameable. The Gorilla, on the other
  hand, is gloomy and ferocious, and quite untameable. When angry the
  Gorilla beats its breast, a statement that was originally made, we
  believe, by M. du Chaillu, but which has been disputed, though it appears
  to be perfectly true. A young Gorilla, exhibited some time since in the
  Gardens of the Zoological Society, could be observed to do so. The cry of
  the Chimpanzee is different from the "howl" of the Gorilla. An immense
  amount has been written upon the ways of this animal in its own home,
  including much that is legendary. The Gorilla has been said to lurk in
  the depths of the forest, and to stretch down a prehensile foot to grasp
  and strangle an unfortunate black man passing below. It is said, too, to
  vanquish the Elephant by hitting it hard upon the trunk with a stout
  stick, and to crumple up the barrel of a rifle with its powerful teeth.
  <!-- Page 576 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page576"></a>{576}</span></p>

  <p>Apart from the doubtful "Pongo" and "Engeco" of Andrew Battel, our
  first intelligence concerning the Gorilla is due to Dr. Savage, after
  whom, indeed, the late Sir Richard Owen called the animal <i>Troglodytes
  savagei</i>, a name which has to be abandoned in favour of an earlier
  name.</p>

  <p>The Gorilla is limited in its distribution to the forest tract of the
  Gaboon. It goes about in families, with but one adult male, who later has
  to dispute his position as leader of the band with another male, whom he
  kills or drives away, or by whom he is killed or driven away. The animal
  is said to make a nest in a tree like the Orang; but this statement has
  been questioned.</p>

  <p>It feeds upon the berries of various plants, and upon other vegetable
  substances; there is apparently not so marked an inclination for animal
  food as is exhibited by the Chimpanzee. In search of their food they
  wander through the forest, walking partly upon the bent hand, and
  progressing with a shuffling gait. It is noteworthy that the Gorilla has
  been said to walk upon the palm of the hand and not upon the back, as is
  the case with the Chimpanzee. It can readily assume the upright posture,
  and, in this case, balances itself largely with its arms. Professor
  Hartmann, however, states that the back of the hand is also used. Unlike
  most or many wild beasts, the Gorilla exhibits no desire to run away when
  he views a human enemy. Dr. Savage remarks that "when the male is first
  seen, he gives a terrific yell, that resounds far and wide through the
  forest, something like kh-ah! kh-ah! prolonged and shrill." This is
  accompanied by offensive tactics, which the natives do not willingly
  encounter. When making an attack the Gorilla rises to his feet, and as a
  full-grown animal reaches a height of some five feet, he is a most
  formidable antagonist. The attack of one of these animals is said to be
  made with the hand, with which he strikes his adversary to the ground,
  and then uses the powerful canines. The beating of the breast which
  heralds an attack is a statement made by M. du Chaillu. It has been
  denied with a vigour and asperity quite incommensurate with the
  importance of the matter.<a name="NtA_423"

  <p>The Chimpanzees, genus <i>Anthropopithecus</i> (or
  <i>Troglodytes</i>), are <!-- Page 577 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page577"></a>{577}</span>to be distinguished from the Gorilla by
  the characters mentioned in the account of the latter animal. Briefly
  summed up they are mainly as follows<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span>The
  ears are large, and generally stand out from the head; but there are
  exceptions to be noted <!-- Page 578 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page578"></a>{578}</span>presently. The pigmentation of the body is
  not always so pronounced as in the Gorilla. The nasal bones are shorter.
  The skull as a whole is more brachycephalic, and the molar teeth are
  smaller. The hands and feet are much longer, the animal being more purely
  arboreal than the Gorilla. The female Chimpanzee is slightly smaller than
  the male, but the great disparity observable in the Gorilla does not
  characterise its ally. The animal, like the Gorilla, has large air
  sacs.</p>

(After de Blainville.)</p>

  <p>Chimpanzees are entirely restricted to Africa, and though they appear
  to extend rather farther east than the Gorilla, the forest-clad region of
  the equatorial belt is their home.</p>

  <p>It has been mentioned in treating of the Gorilla that the main feature
  of this animal, which affords a constant difference from the Chimpanzee,
  is its gloomy and ferocious manner. The Chimpanzee, on the other hand, is
  lively and playful, though often maliciously so, and quite tameable, as
  many instances&mdash;particularly the notorious "Sally" of the Zoological
  Gardens&mdash;show. The earliest mention of animals that are probably
  Chimpanzees is to be found in a work upon the Kingdom of Congo, published
  in 1598. In a cut illustrating that work, and of <!-- Page 579 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page579"></a>{579}</span>which a part is
  reproduced in Professor Huxley's essay referred to below,<a
  name="NtA_424" href="#Nt_424"><sup>[424]</sup></a> the Apes, which
  correspond roughly in their appearance to Chimpanzees, are represented as
  being captured by the device of limed boots, which the Apes are putting
  on. This idea has been subsequently imitated and acted upon. A little
  later, Andrew Battel wrote of the Pongo and of another creature the
  Engeco. This latter, whatever may be the case with the former, is in all
  probability the Chimpanzee, since the word 'Nchego, now applied to those
  creatures, seems to be the same word. From this seems also to be derived
  the sailor's term "Jacko." Whether there are or are not more than one
  species of Chimpanzee, is a matter which has exercised and perplexed
  naturalists. That there are plain differences of external features, at
  any rate between individuals, is perfectly clear. We are justified in
  recognising three forms, but the question of their specific distinctness
  may for the present be held in reserve. The commonest of these is the
  variety known as <i>A. troglodytes</i>. This is frequent in menageries,
  though the specimens on view are nearly always young and small. The face
  and the hands are flesh-coloured, and the ears are very large. The black
  hair gets a reddish tinge on the flanks. The second variety is that which
  was termed by du Chaillu <i>Troglodytes kooloo-kamba</i>. This animal
  appears to be also the <i>T. aubryi</i> of MM. Gratiolet and Alix,<a
  name="NtA_425" href="#Nt_425"><sup>[425]</sup></a> and to be identical
  with two Apes known by the names of "Mafuca" and "Johanna."<a
  name="NtA_426" href="#Nt_426"><sup>[426]</sup></a> The former of these
  was exhibited in Dresden, the latter at Messrs. Barnum and Bailey's show.
  The two animals have been carefully studied. They differ from the common
  Chimpanzee by the dark colour of the face, and in the case of Mafuca the
  ear was Gorilline in form. So too was the ear of <i>A. aubryi</i>, while
  Johanna has a larger one. These features have led to the suggestion that
  the Kooloo-kamba was the result of a mésalliance between a Gorilla and a
  common Chimpanzee.</p>

  <p>It has at any rate been stated that the two Anthropoids do go about in
  company; but there seems to be little doubt that there is no question
  here of a hybrid. Dr. Keith's careful studies<a name="NtA_427"
  href="#Nt_427"><sup>[427]</sup></a> upon Johanna have demonstrated the
  impossibility of <!-- Page 580 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page580"></a>{580}</span>regarding this Ape as anything but a
  Chimpanzee. The animal has the ways and manners of the Chimpanzee; has a
  cry exactly like that of <i>A. troglodytes</i>; does not beat her breast
  like a Gorilla when annoyed. Anatomical knowledge, however, of this
  specimen is at present wanting.</p>

  <p><i>Anthropopithecus calvus</i><a name="NtA_428"
  href="#Nt_428"><sup>[428]</sup></a> seems to be at least as much entitled
  to distinction as the last. It was originally described by du Chaillu;
  but Dr. Gray who examined the skins thought that the baldness was
  accidental, and then after this wise caution proceeded to describe, under
  the name of <i>A. vellerosus</i>, perhaps the "worst" species of
  Chimpanzee that has been added to the unnecessarily long list of
  "species" of Chimpanzees. To this variety belonged "Sally"<a
  name="NtA_429" href="#Nt_429"><sup>[429]</sup></a> of the Zoo, whose
  intelligence has been celebrated by the late Dr. Romanes. The form is
  characterised <!-- Page 581 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page581"></a>{581}</span>by its intense blackness, the red
  reflection of other Chimpanzees not being visible; also by the bald head,
  whence of course the name. The nostrils of this Ape, as of Johanna, were
  somewhat expanded, and thus present a certain likeness to the Gorilla.
  But there can be no suggestion that <i>A. calvus</i> is the product of a
  union between the two African Anthropoids. As is the case with Johanna,
  Sally was given and enjoyed animal food on occasions. It is a curious
  fact that both Sally and Johanna appear to have been colour-blind.</p>

  <p>The Orang Utan, genus <i>Simia</i>, has but one definable species,
  viz. <i>S. satyrus</i>. The supposed species of Owen, <i>S. morio</i>,
  cannot be satisfactorily defined. Plenty of other specific names have

<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 279.&mdash;Skeleton of Orang. <i>Simia satyrus.</i> (After de Blainville.)</p>

  <p>The name Orang-Utan, now applied exclusively to the subject of the
  present description, was formerly applied also to the Chimpanzee, and to
  that animal, moreover, under the latinised version of <i>Homo
  sylvestris</i>. The Orang is a large and heavy Ape with a particularly
  protuberant belly and a melancholy expression. The face of the old male
  is broadened by a kind of callous expansion of naked skin at the sides.
  The colour of the animal is a yellow brown, varying in the exact shade.
  The ears are particularly small and graceful in appearance, pressed
  closely to the sides of the head. The head is very brachycephalic. The
  arms are very long, and when the animal is in the erect posture they
  reach as far as the ankle. The hallux is very short and usually destitute
  of a nail. It is a curious fact that the head of the thigh bone is
  unattached by a ligament to the socket of the pelvis in which it
  articulates, a state of affairs which may give the limb greater freedom
  in movement, but does not add to its strength; <!-- Page 583 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page583"></a>{583}</span>indeed, the Orang has
  been described as moving with laborious caution.</p>

  <p>This Ape inhabits flat and forest-clad ground, and lives mainly in the
  trees. The male leads a solitary life except at the pairing season, but
  the female goes about with her family. On the ground the Orang walks with
  no great ease, and uses his arms as crutches to swing the body along.
  Even on trees the rate of progress is not rapid, and is accomplished with
  careful investigations as to the capabilities of the branches to bear his
  weight. The "Man of the Woods" has been stated to build a hut in trees.
  This is an exaggeration of the fact that it constructs a temporary
  nest.</p>

<i>Structure of Man</i>.)</p>

  <p>One of these nests has lately been described elaborately by Dr.
  Moebius. It was found (by Dr. Selenka) on the fork of a tree at a height
  of 11 metres from the ground. Every night, as it appears, or every second
  night, the animal constructs a new nest for himself, abandoning the old
  one. So numerous, therefore, are these nests in localities frequented by
  Orangs, that a dozen can be readily found in a day. The particular nest
  which Dr. Moebius examined was 1.42 metres long, and at most .80 metre
  broad. It was built of about twenty-five branches, broken off and laid
  for <!-- Page 584 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page584"></a>{584}</span>the most part parallel to each other.
  Above this framework a number of loose leaves lay. There is no doubt,
  therefore, that these nests are not by any means elaborate structures,
  and that they only serve as sleeping-places, and not as nurseries for the
  upbringing of the young, as has been asserted.</p>

  <p>The Orang seems to be usually of a fairly mild disposition; it will
  rarely attack a man unprovoked. But Dr. Wallace, who has accumulated a
  large number of observations upon these animals, describes a female Orang
  who "on a durian tree kept up for at least ten minutes a continuous
  shower of branches, and of the heavy-spined fruits as large as
  32-pounders, which most effectually kept us clear of the tree she was on.
  She could be seen breaking them off and throwing them down with every
  appearance of rage, uttering at intervals a loud pumping grunt, and
  evidently meaning mischief." The name given by the Dyaks to the Orang is
  Mias Pappan.<a name="NtA_430" href="#Nt_430"><sup>[430]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Fossil Anthropoid Apes.</b>&mdash;Undoubtedly the most interesting
  of fossil Anthropoids is the now famous <i>Pithecanthropus erectus</i>.
  Our knowledge of it is due in the first place to Dubois.<a name="NtA_431"
  href="#Nt_431"><sup>[431]</sup></a> But there is hardly an anatomist or
  an anthropologist who has not had his say upon this regrettably very
  incomplete remnant. The creature is only known by a calvarium, two
  separate teeth, and a femur. And the femur, moreover, is diseased. M.
  Dubois discovered these remains in the island of Java in andesite tufa of
  Pliocene or at least early Pleistocene age. The remains were found in
  company with <i>Stegodon</i>, which is now extinct, and
  <i>Hippopotamus</i>, which is no longer found in that part of the world.
  The name <i>Pithecanthropus</i> was given to it by the discoverer in
  order to furnish with a definite habitation and a name the theoretical
  <i>Pithecanthropus</i> of Haeckel. Even the most particular of students
  of mammalian nomenclature will hardly object to the utilisation of a name
  for a second time which is with some clearness a <i>nomen nudum</i>! The
  animal when erect must have stood 5 feet 6 inches high. The contents of
  the cranium must have been 1000 cm., that is to say 400 cm. more than the
  cranial capacity of any Anthropoid <!-- Page 585 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page585"></a>{585}</span>Ape, and quite as great
  as or even a trifle greater than the cranial capacity of some female
  Australians and Veddahs. But as these latter are not 5 feet in height,
  the Ape-like man had really a less capacious cerebral cavity. The skull
  in its profile outline stands roughly midway between that of a young
  Chimpanzee (young in order to do away with the secondary modifications
  caused by the crest) and the lowest human skull, that of Neanderthal Man.
  This creature is truly, as Professor Haeckel put it, "the long searched
  for 'missing link,'" in other words represents "the commencement of
  humanity."</p>

  <p>The remains of Apes, more distinctly Apes than <i>Pithecanthropus</i>,
  are known from Miocene strata of France. Two genera, <i>Pliopithecus</i>
  and <i>Dryopithecus</i>, are known. The former appears to be close to
  <i>Hylobates</i>. <i>Dryopithecus</i> is more Man-like than any other,
  and seems to have been as large as a Chimpanzee. The incisors are human
  in their relatively small size. But it has been pointed out that the long
  and narrow symphysis of the lower jaw is a point of likeness to the
  Cercopithecidae.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Hominidae.</b>&mdash;Apart from <i>Pithecanthropus</i>,
  which perhaps is a member of this family, but whose remains permit us to
  leave it among the Simiidae, at least for the present, the family
  Hominidae contains but one genus, <i>Homo</i>, and probably but one
  species, <i>H. sapiens</i>. The characters of the family may therefore be
  merged in those of the genus.<a name="NtA_432"
  href="#Nt_432"><sup>[432]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Though it is easy enough to distinguish a Man from an Ape, it is by no
  means easy to find absolutely distinctive characters which are other than
  "relative." As Professor Haeckel has pointed out, there are really only
  four characters which differentiate Man: these are the erect walk, and
  the consequent modification of the fore- and hind-limbs to that position;
  the existence of articulate speech; the faculty of reason. Whether one
  body of psychologists are right who argue that reason is a distinctive
  human attribute, not to be confused with the apparent reasoning powers of
  lower animals, or whether others are justified in separating Man only in
  degree from the lower animals, it is clear that this very diversity of
  opinion prevents us for the present from utilising such characters as
  absolute differences. In any case the discussion of these matters is
  beyond the scope of the present book. <!-- Page 586 --><span

<p class="captctr"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 281.&mdash;Skull of Immanuel Kant. (After C. von Kupffer.) The great size of the
cranium is a noteworthy feature. (From Wiedersheim's <i>Structure of Man</i>.)</p>

  <p>Anatomically there are a number of small points which distinguish Man;
  but they are mainly due to the erect gait. It is sometimes attempted to
  divide Man as a naked animal. But this is an apparent difference only;
  the hair is not so much developed upon the body as in the Apes, save in
  occasional abnormalities, such as the various hairy men and women who can
  be seen in travelling shows, and to a less extent the Japanese Ainos, but
  it is present everywhere, as is shown by microscopical investigation of
  the skin. The skull in Man "is a smooth and imposing, rounded or oval
  bony case," which contrasts with the smaller and deeply ridged skull of
  the Anthropoid Apes. The shape of the skull is largely in accord with the
  large brain. The face does not project so much as in the Anthropoid Apes,
  though this character must not <!-- Page 587 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page587"></a>{587}</span>be insisted upon too strongly, as in some
  American Monkeys the face is as little projecting. Still we are now
  comparing Man with his undoubtedly nearest relatives the Simiidae. In the
  lower jaw the anterior line at the symphysis is an approximately straight
  one, that is at right angles to the long axis of the jaw, while Apes have
  a more retreating chin. The "beautiful sigmoid curve formed by the lumbar
  and dorsal vertebrae" is more pronounced in Man, but exists not only in
  the Anthropoids, but in other Apes.<a name="NtA_433"

  <p>The fore-limbs are relatively short, the extreme length of the arm
  being such that the outstretched hand does not reach the knee. The thumb
  is a large and useful digit in Man, much more so than in the Anthropoids.
  On the other hand the hallux is not opposable. This is, of course,
  correlated with the upright attitude, as is also the greater relative
  thickness of that digit, upon which <!-- Page 588 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page588"></a>{588}</span>the greatest stress is
  laid in walking. As to muscles, the glutaeus maximus is more developed in
  Man&mdash;the Ape which most nearly approaches him being the Gorilla, in
  which animal the life is less thoroughly arboreal than in some others.
  The so-called "scansorius" is only present in Man as an occasional
  occurrence. The rudimentary character of the ear muscles for the movement
  of the external ear in Man has often been insisted upon, as also their
  occasional functional activity. But here and elsewhere, so numerous are
  the abnormalities, that "the gap which usually separates the muscular
  system of Man from that of the Anthropoids appears to be completely
  bridged over." These are words of Professor Wiedersheim quoted from
  Testut, and express a final summary of the matter of muscles in Man and
  the Apes. <!-- Page 589 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>In his teeth Man differs by the small exaggeration of the canines,
  which hardly, if at all, differ in the two sexes. There is also a
  complete absence of a diastema. The teeth are also on the whole weaker
  than in the Anthropoids, though <i>Hylobates</i> is very human in this
  particular.</p>

  <p>There is a tendency in Man towards the disappearance of the upper
  outer incisors, and more markedly still of the wisdom teeth, which appear
  very late, and are often imperfect. In a large number of cases the tooth
  does not appear at all. In the larynx there is no great development of
  the great throat pouches of the Anthropoids. The minute diverticula of
  that organ, known to human anatomists as the ventricles of Morgagni,
  alone remain to testify to a former howling apparatus in the ancestors of
  Man.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_1" href="#NtA_1">[1]</a> The degeneration of the hind-limb

  href="#page90">90</a>. Dr. Bonavia has recently advanced (<i>Studies in
  Evolution</i>, London, 1895) the somewhat fantastic view that the
  pigment-patches of Carnivorous and other mammals are a reminiscence of an
  earlier scaly condition. There is no direct evidence that the primitive
  mammals were scaly, nor are the Monotremata or Marsupials furnished with
  any more traces of such a condition than are other mammals; and they are
  the most lowly organised of existing Mammalia.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
